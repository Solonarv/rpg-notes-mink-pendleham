Valentina von Zapp

mid-range fleshsmith/creature-merchant

we have an invitation to one of her sidelabs to discuss details. it's a small basement-ish room with some glassware around, but nothing too crazy.

she's short, very big glasses, metal backpack.

straight down to business, she asks about the creature. We tell her what we know and have inferred about the frog, and the basic layout of the extradimensional space it's in.

She can't contain it, since she doesn't know what its capabilities are, but she's fine with killing it and taking the parts as payment for her help.

She specializes in electricity. The easiest way, she says, is to shoot it with a giant lightning bolt. Takes a lot of power, though, which she doesn't have, but knows where to get.

We discuss some other options based on the frog's tendency to eat and swallow anything that moves:
- feed it a bladder of acid
- feed it a shocker device - would have to carry its own power, batteries are too big, doesn't work
- feed it the end of a cable, to deliver a shock

plan:
Hire a boat - she's not doing this in her lab
Open the door on the boat
Park it in the bay
Power will come from:
under the bay is a train line. the trains are partly biological train creatures, sometimes they have problems. back when this train network was well-developed, there were maintenance rooms next to the tracks; there is one inside the tunnel. These have defibrillators in them; big ones!
However the tunnels are flooded. The maintenance room has a big defibrillator¹ for the train creatures. 

She suggests: best way to get in there? through the tunnel!

She shoos us out and tells us to contact her when we have the device.

¹ defibrillators are fleshsmithing devices: big battery + jumper cables to zap fleshsmithing creatures to life. some radicals have been experimenting with using small-scale defibrillators to help people with heart issues.

Next day

Bendren prepares *water breathing* and Yala quickly learns it from him.

Artur vaguely recalls ferrets being involved with the train system somehow. He goes to ask Prof. Mink, but the professor has a very busy day. Artur manages to catch him on his lunch break and ask just a few questions: any details about the relation of ferrets to the tunnels? Prof. Mink is a bit grumpy at Artur not already remembering from the lectures: ferrets have been used for communication (running through tubes carrying messages -  like pneumatic tubes, only it's ferrets), this project was abandoned though. Having gotten the sense that Prof. Mink probably *could* provide maps in exchange for a future favor, he goes for it. Prof. Mink gives him the key to his office and tells him where to find the tunnel map, which is quite detailed.

In the meantime, Yala does her own information gathering. She finds nothing at first, but eventually one of the people we saved says she knows a guy.
drinking companion at the bar, works at the trains. He's kinda drunk, not in the best shape, but has info about the tunnels. Writes down a maintenance schedule for the tunnel: at X time this week there will not be any trains in the tunnel.

We reconvene in the evening to discuss what we found. The maintenance window is a couple hours tomorrow and another couple hours the day after.

We'd have to traverse about 1000-500m of tunnel, which would take about half an hour.

Yala runs over to Valentina to let her know we're grabbing the defibrillator tomorrow, and when. She tells us she'll have the boat ready.

After ensuring we have our spells in a row, we set off the next day. Yala leaves her spellbook at home. Bendren prepares *light* so he and Artur can see.

Yala casts *water breathing* on everyone and we simply hop off the station into the tunnel. As we continue along the tunnel, it becomes increasingly flooded. Shortly before it submerges entirely, we notice the whooosh of an oncoming train behind us - evidently, the drunk train worker was wrong about the maintenance times.

We scramble to grab some nearby handholds. Baffled train passengers watch us through the windows. Artur does get swept away and bonks into the tail end of the train, but isn't too hurt.

Based on how frequently the trains run, we should have plenty of time to reach the maintenance room. Now that we know trains are running, we can time them and hide in side tunnels etc. when a train passes.

RULING: spellcasting using water breathing is a DC5 flat check or lose the spell.

pretty soon we reach the door to the maintenance room with the defibrillator. The room is flooded, though there are some air pockets near the ceiling. Order: Yala, Artur, Bendren.

Yala doesn't notice a sneaky fish. It's not happy about our visit. Combat!

Round 1:
- Bendren: divine lance @ fish, except not - casting under water is hard. swim into the room.
- Artur: subtle evil eye @ fish, fish fails, becomes sickened 1. release griffin.
- Fish: swim to Yala. Bite, critmiss, it slams into the wall. Bite again, hit for 16 p (!!).
- Yala: cast protective wards. raise shield. swim away from fish.

Round 2:
- Bendren: swim inside. divine lance @ fish, 15 miss.
- Artur: subtle revealing light, fish crit succeeds.
- Fish, not happy but no longer sick: swim toward artur. Bite, miss. Again, miss.
- Yala: sustain wards. 2× swim toward other room, around fish.

Round 3:
- Bendren: cast flense @ fish, crit miss.
- Artur: 3× swim into other room
- Fish: swim to Yala. Bite, miss. Bite, crit for 32 p (ow), she's down.

Round 4:
- Bendren: 2× swim into other room. 1⋄ heal Yala for 2.
- Artur: command griffin { 2× swim in here }. daze @ fish: fish fails, takes 2 mental.
- Yala: swim into other room, needle darts @ fish: 27 hits for 7 p.
- Fish, very angry: swim to door, try really hard to squeeze in there. Bite griffin: 11 critmiss, it slams its face into the door. Rear back and bite again, critmiss again, slam its face into the wall again.

Round 5:
- Bendren: divine lance @ fish, 22 hit for 7 spirit.
- Artur: { griffin move to safety }, phase bolt @ fish: 28 hit for 11 p.
- Yala: needle darts @ fish, 12 miss. Raise shield.
- Fish, thinking better of it: starts to swim away, gets to the door. Notices the train, slinks back into the room and shoves itself into a corner (this doesn't work very well).

Round 6:
- Bendren: divine lance @ fish, 20 miss.
- Artur: evil eye @ fish, fish fails, become sickened 1. phase bolt @ fish, 25 hit for 15 p.
- Yala: needle darts @ fish, 13 miss. Raise shield.
- Fish swims away after the train passes.

Bendren heals Yala for 21. We grab the defibrillator and go; Artur sticks a sigil on it. It's pretty close to neutrally buoyant, so pretty easy to carry.

Marching order: Yala ahead (she sees best), Artur and Bendren next, carrying the box. Artur casts *know direction* every so often to keep us on the right path.

As we walk along, the fish returns. It wants blood! Combat again!
- Artur: subtle daze @ fish, it fails, takes 4 mental.
- Bendren: boneshaker @ fish², fish succeeds, takes 15/2=7 b. It dies.

² does boneshaker work on a shark: yes, according to HW

At Yala's urging, Artur and Bendren wisely decide to leave the shark where it is. We get out.
