Haskell was off looking for components to make a brother to Flamelli, but that didn't work out. He plies his trade to make a living.

He returns home and finds a note from the rest of us, informing him to meet us at a convenient location. We bring him up to speed.

We return to the sewer grate, which Haskell opens and we descend into. The trail, unfortunately, ends at the water flowing through the sewers.

Pendleham's sewers are quite large, with walkways alongside a central canal. Bendren lights the way with his mechanical torch.

Haskell hands a couple of drakeheart mutagens to Bendren.

We decide to check out the fleshsmithing labs' sewer connections to see if the trail reemerges anywhere there.

We start with the lab closest to the shoreline, which is nearest to us. Bendren leads us there unerringly using Yala's sketched copy of the gendarmerie's sewer map, which is somewhat outdated.

At the first big junction, we find something interesting: the main pipe is totally blocked off, the sewage piling up pretty high and overflowing into side pipes. This doesn't seem entirely natural - bricks and shards of bone piled up just right.

All the pieces are broken off from the walls or the ceiling in adjacent pipes, and all have scratch marks - they seem to have been deliberately erected. blockage reaches almost to the ceiling, with just a small gap at the very top.

After some discussion, we try to just go around it. Bendren finds a route without too much trouble, but as we traverse it, something leaps out of the water at Yala! she immediately sees it's some kind of skeletal monster with just thin flesh stretched across it, a very long tail with a wicked spike at the end.

round 1:
Snatcher (from stealth): claw @ Yala, 21 hits for 8 slash. tail @ bendren, 10 miss.
Yala: 1⋄ get protective wards up, 2⋄ critmiss with phase bolt
Haskell: command Flamelli: {feed me a bestial mutagen}; leap across the sewer canal, flanking with Yala; punch snatcher, miss.
Bendren: cast Flense, 18 miss.

round 2:
Snatcher: claw @ Yala, 25 hits for 7 slash. grab, 18 succeeds. reposition, dunking Yala into the water
Yala: fail to not-drown, 6 rounds left. sustain wards. attempt escape, 13 fails. RK snatcher: it probably understands simple commands. 4 rounds left.
Haskell: grapple snatcher, 27 succeeds: he's got it by the neck. punch, 21 hit for 9 bonk- which it's weak to! raise shield.
Bendren: 2⋄ heal Yala for 15. raise shield.

round 3:
Snatcher: tail @ Haskell, 28 hit for 4 p. again, 17 miss. escape Haskell's grab, barely. {float down the current}
Yala: fail to not-drown, still. cast command, will save fails: release me! sustain wards. 2 rounds left.
Haskell: Step, strike, strike; all fail.
Bendren: divine lance, 20 hits for 5 spirit. drag Yala back onto more solid ground, despite the snatcher: 24, succeeds.

round 4:
Snatcher: release Yala. tail @ Haskell, miss. swim away down the tunnel.

combat ends. Yala spends a good minute or two frantically prestidigitating herself clean/dry after being dunked.

we follow it, but not swiftly. the route takes us past the blockage, and based on the waterflow, there might be some kind of hole underneath it? in the style of a beaver dam, perhaps?

we come to a series of pipes that split away from the main channel. there should be a way into this lab here, but the exact place isn't marked on the map because its scale isn't that precise.

Yala looks for claw marks, and finds some - but they seem to just be where the snatcher chipped away material for the blockage. Flamelli has better luck, finding a strange home-like smell in one of the side passages.

That pipe has only a small trickle of water, which seems relatively clear too. Haskell jumps over there first (athletics ok), but lands on something slippery and keeps his balance (acrobatics ok). It's the snatcher! combat again:

Round 1:
Haskell: 0⋄ flashback bestial mutagen. strike 2x: 26 hit for 7 bonk, 13 miss. raise shield.
Yala: 3⋄ force barrage for 11 force total
Snatcher: rear up, try to tailstab Haskell: 27 hit for 8 p. claw, 28 crit for 14 slash. grab, 20 succeeds.
Bendren: 2⋄ divine lance, 28 crits for 8 spirit. raise shield.

Round 2:
Haskell: strike, 10 miss; heropoint reroll, 14 still misses. again, 23 hit for 8+5 bonk. raise shield.
Yala: 2⋄ electric arc, it succeeds for 3/2=1 electricity. demoralize, fails.
Snatcher: 1⋄ reaffirm grip on Bendren, run away with him. It's 50ft down that pipe.
Bendren: 2⋄ long jump into the pipe (success), run further.

Round 3:
Haskell: strike, 19 hit for 5+5 bonk. crunch, dead.

We follow that pipe into the snatcher's lair. We drag it up the pipe, eventually reaching a relatively dry area - a technical cellar under a lab of some sort, full of cauldrons, beakers

Haskell and Yala are a little too distracted by their recent near-abductions to do a very good job exploring.

Bendren's unshaken fortitude allows him to find...
a nest in a corner, in which he finds corpses, and one somewhat-alive person - the guy who got abducted last night, in fact.

Bendren quickly applies some first aid and shoves a *heal* spell into him.

There's not much in this lab, it's very dilapidated. As we search through it, we find that there are some tanks for fleshsmithing creations, one of which looks to have been broken open from the inside recently. The labels indicate that this creature is a Snatcher, intended to bring victims to a fleshsmith.

We find no signs of anyone entering or exiting the lab, it seems the creature just went through the sewers. Instinctual behavior, perhaps? But there should be a lot more corpses here, if that's what it was doing; there were only two corpses here!

Bendren and Haskell get to work on roughly breaking down the monster into more easily carried parts while Yala goes to talk to the gendarme.

The cop is happy to see that we resolved the problem with no input from his part, and happily trusts Yala's word on this. He also suggests solving the 

The guy we found still alive thanks us for saving his life from the beast, then runs off immediately.

Bendren and Haskell spend the rest of the day sorting through the snatcher's parts and appraising them. Yala starts digging into paperwork to try and attack this mystery from the demand side: who might have been taking those corpses, reselling them? There are a lot of documents from the von Brahm case to go over.
