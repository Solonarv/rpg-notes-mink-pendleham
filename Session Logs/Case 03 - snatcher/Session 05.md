Downtime (2 weeks):

Bendren trained Rian
Yala - 1 week earn income, 1 week spell research / interviewing locals / shopping / surgery
Artur - looking for magical knowledge

Fleshsmithing augments:
Yala - yes, augment to cast *jump* spell once/minute
Bendren - a set of chitinous/bony plates on his forearm that funcions as a *sturdy shield*
Artur - yes

Ruling: spells can be found in written form, for copying into one's book. Costs half as much as the corresponding scroll.

Next case:

Yala gets a letter from an acquaintaince about a potential scoop. Seems like her sort of thing. There have been rumors in all sorts of places: in Pendleham's docks, someone has been kidnapping people, even some important people, and it's not very clear where they end up. Also, rumors that perhaps one of the abandoned labs there has been reactivated, perhaps even monsters patrolling the streets.

Artur readily agrees to go investigate this. Haskell is busy with something related to the university, but Bendren is free.

The rumors are concentrated in a seedier part of the docks. 

somewhat abandoned and run-down since the collapse of the imperium

warehouses, some businesses (loading/unloading goods, etc), but docks here aren't built for large ships, so mostly small operations here. some people live here, some taverns, other stuff, admin buildings.

we decide to start in a tavern - *the* tavern, there's just one: the Drunken Fool. small building, sign is chipped and faded, clearly used to resemble a very drunk person but now just looks like a blob. Inside, can see quite a few people, some partying, some just drowning their sorrows, others enjoying a meal. bartender is a larger man, red hair, muscular arms covered with tattoos; talking to one of the patrons.

this one is dressed a little better than the other patrons, talking to the bartender in a quiet voice about something-or-other.

there are sailors, and very run-down-looking guys as if the docks were condensed into a person who was then beaten with steel-toed boots

Yala spots a woman in a tattered cloak with a pair of animal ears sticking up from her head. She's clutching a mug of beer, hunched over a bowl of soup, eyes flicking around the room. As she spots us, she seems to evaluate us.

We approach her, ask if we can join her.

usual spiel: memory not so great, malnutrition. Yala slides her a gold piece.

Imperial gendarmerie have been more active recently, it's strange. poking around the streets, spooking us good folk, looking for somebody. maybe one of those important people of yours, maybe not, can never tell with them. maybe they will know something, they have a station not too far from here. maybe ask them?

also heard: people not so much going missing, rather a creature stalking the night, snatching people off the streets. nobody's seen it properly and managed to run away, only shadows and figures, screams from an alley that you turn away from. kind of tall, long tail, can run very very fast? better be ready if it finds you. She lists some place where people have been snatched away from.

this has been going on for a couple months, more so as of recently - 4-5 weeks ago.

Yala muses out loud if this might be related to Adrian von Brahm's supply of probably-suspiciously-cheap human brains.

Yala asks after her name, and gives her own. People have been calling this woman Little Claw; she shows off her hand, which is indeed clawed. Yala thanks her for the help.

Bendren asks how frequent the disappearances were. She's not really sure, since she doesn't know all the disappearances. Recently though, not a day passes without hearing of another disappearance.

Artur asks if there's some kind of non-government organization that's relevant here: she snorts, which of the 17 "organizations" do you want to know about?

Yala: just the two or three who are most influential, or easiest to talk to?
- gendarmerie
- org I'm a part of, a little better than the gendarmerie, I could introduce you?

Little claw fishes for more payment. Yala calls out her lack of subtlety, then elbows Artur and says "hey, cough it up." He shows off 5 sp, which Little Claw snatches up very quickly. She says she can show us where they are.

She quickly polishes off her meal, and takes us a bare few steps outside before noting that we stick out like perfectly healthy thumbs on a hand near-skeletal from hunger. We try unsuccessfully to hang our heads and look beaten down as we should.

Little Claw takes us on a labyrinthine course through the docks, eventually taking us to a small building where two people are gambling. They look rough, with big daggers strapped to their waists, and they look at us strangely. One has a glowing pair of eyes, the other has a pair of tusks jutting out of his mouth that shift back and forth as he looks at us.

Our guide instructs us to stop looking at them, "they're not important". The pair doesn't stop looking at us, though. She leads us past them, into the building. Inside is even seedier than the Drunken Fool, all sorts of unsavory individuals hanging out and doing various business. She grabs two of us by the hands and pulls us all into one of the corners, where people looking a little like her are sitting. She introduces us as looking into the night snatcher, instructs them to tell us what they know.

Bendren: have you been looking into things? - no, mostly just trying to survive here.
Yala: last time you saw a snatching? one of them: this morning. a... not friend, kind of an asshole, but didn't deserve to be eaten or carved up for parts. I was going to where he sleeps, then out of the corner of my eye I see this thing, like a streak of red in the night. Right where he slept! then it was up, up the wall, a long glimpse, a long tail, then it was gone. I ran away, came back when it was daylight. My friend wasn't there, but all his things were still there. The others chime in with similar stories. This adds some more POIs to our map.
Yala: where was this exactly? He describes the location.
Bendren asks after frequency of disappearances. They concur with Little Claw's information.
Discussion: what do? Bendren thinks of a stakeout, might take several nights. Yala suggests just looking for a trail at the place this 'friend' got snatched from.
Artur: seen anyone who looks like {insert description of Adrian von Brahm}? They don't recall so, but don't really memorize faces like that
Yala: has the gendarmerie been doing anything useful about this? Answers: they never do anything useful. One notes: some of them may, in between the beatings, have been asking about the monster too.
One wonders why we're looking into this.
Bendren: concerned citizen ("a what?")
Yala: investigative reporter. - oh! like one of those people who write about cool monsters here in Pendleham! You know, I heard about a cool monster... (proceeds to spin a yarn about a monster that's a fish with a human head, or vice versa; probably completely made up). (ignoring Yala's attempts to explain what she actually writes about)
Yala, when asked: our plan, ideally, is to stop the monster and *then* write a story about it.
The guys: ok, we'll let you know if we see anything.
Yala: you can find us at Mme Arlette's {insert location}, or we'll check in at the Drunken Fool every so often.
(Yala's Society check: yeah, she can easily find her way back here whenever she wants)

As we leave (for the gendarmerie), Little Claw catches up with us and asks us about our plans. She immediately assumes the gendarmerie is at fault, despite Yala pointing out how it doesn't add up. She also helpfully informs us that we've been overpaying, then splits again before we get too close to the gendarmerie station.

The building looks a little less run-down than its surroundings, but still pretty bad. The doors - thick bone, a small grate to look through - are closed.

Cops aren't fond of investigative reporters like Yala. "Concerned citizens" who just want to help are cool though, since they're just free labor. She sends Artur up to lie to the cops, we're definitely just here to help.

The cop at the door initially denies the existence of any problems, but mellows out when Artur insists we're here to solve the problem, *free of charge*. Naturally, the cop charges *us* an entry fee before letting us in, but it's only 5 cp (each).

The cop continues being obstructive.

Yala points out that we *would*

they've investigated the monster: fleshsmithed creation, probably. "not many people know this, but sometimes, bad fleshsmiths, they kidnap people and use them for parts. we try to keep this secret to not cause a panic." gives us a broad description: 2m tall, broad claws, climbs walls, can see in the dark or otherwise orient itself. don't know where it lives, but everything's centered on the docks. maybe it made a nest in a warehouse somewhere. They've checked the warehouses next to the kidnappings and found nothing, so maybe that's not right.

Yala asks if the monster is maybe lairing in an abandoned fleshsmithing lab. The cop complains a lot, about a "records tax", but he generously waives that as well and ponderously goes to access the records which would contain info about the fleshsmithing labs.

He returns after 10min with a big map. Notes that if the creation is from a new lab, they have ways of locating that: most labs just dump their waste in the lab, so you can follow that trace upstream. 

He points out three abandoned fleshsmithing labs in the area, and complains about all the reports he'd have to write if a fleshsmithing lab were involved. Yala helpfully points out that if we bring him a monster from a fleshsmithing lab, he doesn't have to write a report: he can just tell us to go away, and nobody ever has to know! The cop snaps his fingers at the genius idea, and suggests Yala would make a great gendarme with a mind like that.

Bendren suggests that the monster may be using the sewers. The cop groans and fetches the sewer map, complaining some more as he does.

We thank the cop for "helping us help you", and take our leave. He ... threatens? promises? to make us pay the proper fees next time, and we had better bring the monster!

We first head to the site of the most recent disappearance.

It's a little alleyway, ends at back of warehouse, someone has been sleeping there (there are some boxes, clothes, improvised bedroll, etc).

Bendren notices that the order is disrupted, the sleeping bag disrupted: a bit of blood inside. something pulled the sleeper out and moved them somewhere. He spots scratches on the warehouse wall nearby, indicating something probably climbed up there.

Yala climbs up, with no skill and a few falls (which leave her unharmed), then ties a rope to a rain cistern so the rest can follow her without risk of falling.

The roof is mostly flat, broken up by rainwater collectors. Bendren easily reads the monster's trail: back down to the ground, along a street, eventually reaching a sewer grate.
