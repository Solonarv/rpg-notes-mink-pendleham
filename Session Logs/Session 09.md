After failing to feign ignorance, Yala tries to bolt up the stairs, but she slips on some spilled liquid and is caught.

about 10 min later: Artur informs Haskell and Bendren to go after him if he doesn't return within a couple of minutes, then sneaks down to check out the situation.

He gets spotted due to peeking around the corner at just the wrong moment. He bolts upstairs too, and manages to remain ahead of the statue-carrying woman. He finds Bendren and Haskell at the top of the stairs.

As the woman pops her head up the stairs, she sees the three of them and immediately runs back down. Artur leads the other two down the stairs after her.

Yala witnesses the woman running downstairs, swearing and "our cover's blown. use the device!" The other woman takes out a big orange glass tank with many wires, attaches it to a wall, and presses a button. It starts ticking ominously.

Yala squirms but doesn't manage to wiggle free of the ropes. She deduces that the device is some kind of bomb and decides to kick it in hopes of inducing a fizzle. She breaks off one of the four spikes attaching it to the wall, causing the orange liquid to leak out - it ignites on contact with the air. Yala starts shouting for help.

Around this time, the thief trio runs into Artur's trio. They stop, Artur suggests not fighting, and - after aborted speculation that we were also here for the book - they let each other pass. Artur's trio reaches Yala and helps get her out of the ropes quickly.

Yala has brief thoughts of shooting the bomb right in the glass tank to induce a fizzle, but shakes her head and starts running up shouting FIRE! with Artur following.

Bendren, by incredible coincidence, has seen this exact bomb before. A dead man with burned hands and a journal in his pocket; one of his bomb ideas was exactly this one. This bomb doesn't explode, instead it pumps its flammable liquid into the walls. Shooting the glass canister is in fact just about the worst thing you could do. He also remembers that the wall insulation is very flammable. This is not good. He also starts running up.

Upon reaching the ground floor, we split and start running around, telling everyone to GTFO. Yala goes upstairs. There's a bit of a panic and a stampede. Haskell warns the other workers and grabs the book on the way.

She announces the same from on top of the auction stage, to the crowd's disbelief. She then runs through the crowd and jumps out the nearest window. Artur follows, with more difficulty.

Bendren, still on the stage, fires his gun into the air to get attention. He once again exhorts the crowd to GTFO, then holsters his pistol and tries to get downstairs. He gets stopped by the crush of workers all trying to squeeze down.

Yala instructs the guests to go down the stairs, then she jumps out the window. A distressingly large number of them decided to follow her out the window instead of risking the stairs.

Haskell bursts into the kitchen and tells everyone to GTFO or become roast. He smashes a bottle on the ground, then runs out. The kitchen workers follow him, some of them snatching up equipment along the way.

Yala lands safely with catlike grace. Artur manages the same, miraculously. The guests aren't so lucky; it's a bloodbath.

Bendren arrives downstairs and finds a crowd bashing on the front door, which is blocked. There's also a bit of smoke in the air, and the walls are heating up. Some people are trying to break down the door; Bendren pitches in using the hammer he had the foresight to bring.

We meet up outside, and flee the scene in short order. As we leave, we see the whole thing go up in flames. There will definitely be no evidence left of anything we did: it all burned up.

We head to the docks and use the sewers to reach our lair while shaking any potential tails. We spend a few hours there to let the heat die down and allow Artur to read/skim the book. Also Bendren patches up Yala.

It's about the production by fermentation of various biochemical liquids. Much info about diseases, could be engineered for a goal, or manipulated, or cured. Artur gets enough understanding that he'll have a leg up on those topics later.

We return to Mme Arlette's, who is barely hiding her fury. Yala gives an overview of what happened, including the other thieves - Yala describes them, she recognizes the strong woman.

Mme Arlette is also somewhat mollified because some of her purchases (via Bendren) already got delivered before the fire broke out. Bendren throws in a description of the bomb, and says - to Mme Arlette's astonishment - that he has a notebook with the bomb schematics. She emphatically decides that she never heard that, and tells him to burn that notebook.

She takes the book and says she'll see if her client still wants it. It takes a few weeks, but eventually we do get paid. Yala writes a scathing article about flammable insulation and bad fire safety.
