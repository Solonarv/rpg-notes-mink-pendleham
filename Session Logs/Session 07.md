downtime:
- Artur works as a research assistant for an auction house: they recently came into possession of a bunch of fleshsmithing equipment, which needs assessing.
	- He gets to know the other workers there. The auction house trades in all sorts of stuff, so long as it can fetch an extravagant price.
	- He manages to snatch up some of the less-valuable things that would get thrown out anyway.
	- One day, he overhears someone planning a theft, of a book that was meant to be on the auction floor. They picked a bad place for their covert discussion, and Artur manages to learn a lot: the storage is divided by levels of security. on the day of the auction, somehow (they don't conveniently repeat how) the main security system of the deeper vaults will be disabled. unclear whether it's their doing. they plan that one of them will sneak down there, take the book, replace it with a fake. they'll move the book to a separate area, and retrieve it several days later.
- Yala writes for local newspapers, and does research with the documents we have picked up.
	- correlating for a lead, comparing lists: von Brahm consistently noted where he got his brains, but coded his notes. the brains from this operation went quickly, must have been a professional operation - not just one random guy.
	- Haskell makes a list of all the big suppliers in the city. comparing with Yala's list, three names show up:
		- old elf, Keitan. native of Pendleham. Has been in the biz for a very long time, already when the city was prosperous. Controls a lot of auction houses for parts, a few fields around Pendleham that grow specialized fleshsmithing materials
		- woman, Tishtar. Not from Pendleham, but has been here a while. Built herself a solid base on smaller fleshsmithing operations; healing etc. Works on buildings too.
		- last guy Mike. Recent newcomer, just a couple years. Expanded rapidly, took over much of the Pendleham underworld (insofar as that's a thing).
	- These own the biggest and most reputable suppliers of parts. Based on the numbers and timelines, at least one of them must be involved.
	- Ownership of the warehouse: nobody owns it now, it's abandoned. But it used to be involved in Pendleham's food imports, owned by one of the bigger import companies, which still exists. Imports all sorts of things, grows all sorts of things, owned by Keitan.
	- von Brahm's financials: he and his partner kept pretty good records. They have a full list of deliveries that their brain beasts performed. Looks pretty innocuous at first, upper-middle-class-ish clients as expected. Digging in deeper, paints a bit of a picture, especially in combination with some visits and a map: a lot of delivery destinations are involved in the trade of expensive luxury items, or are research buildings, or residences of the upper class' employees. Nothing concrete, but an awful lot of very important people have been in the area.
- Haskell does fleshsmithing; experiments with the stuff we've picked up, tries to engineer some new implants
- Bendren works his job

decision about the lab: we're keeping it, restoring and cleaning.

it's under a warehouse, accessed via a concealed door in a rotating bookshelf or via the sewers.

upgrades:
- 15 gp: Install a walkway into the sewers, so you don't have to wade through the water to enter the lab
- 10 gp: Install a basic alarm system for doors leading into the lab

we get both. Bendren covers the 10gp expense. We all pitch in on the cleaning and restoration.



In our lab, we discuss what to do about this book theft. Ideas include:
- ignore it
- work with the thieves, in exchange for our own copy
- report them to the AH
- yoink the book from the secondary location before the thieves retrieve it
We converge on this last option, since it's the least risky one that actually results in us having the book.
The book's name is «Ye Grande Mystique Of Ze Bodily Humours, Imbalance and Sickness, And Treatment Of Substantive Liquids» by Zalpi von Drakenblut.
Building has a ground floor (reception etc), a second floor with the actual auction hall.
second staircase, not accessible to the public, goes down. basement, regular storage. basement-1, basement-2 increasingly secret and secure.
The book is stored in basement-1, secondary location is basement-0.
Security there:
- alarms
- authorized people have tokens to bypass the alarms
- occasional guard patrols
We agree on a plan (TBD)

A few days after this, Mme Arlette approaches Yala and Artur with a job offer: not her usual client, they're being a little shifty about the whole thing. There's an auction that will be happening, they need someone to acquire a book from there. Not very clear what the book is about, pay is decent. She could get us into the auction, but it's a bit short notice. As we express curiosity, Mme Arlette gives more details: book name (the same), big grimoire (50x50cm), big wooden cover, greenish almost-glow, storage location and protections. Will be auctioned off about halfway through the auction, so will be moved out of the storage area then. If someone buys it, it'll be moved to the processing area before being given to the buyer.
Client doesn't want the book sold, will be bad for some reason. Should be taken before it goes up on a lot ideally, or at least before it's sold.
She'll get us into the auction as her representatives; she has attended previously. She'll have us bid on some things (with instructions), so as to not be suspicious.
Yala and Artur accept provisionally, caveating on Bendren + Haskell accepting. Yala also asks after the pay, it'll be 200 gp.
We have two days until the auction. Artur will be working that night.

Yala and Artur go find Bendren and Haskell, talk to them about the offer.
The book is indeed one of the headliners of this auction, though not the top one.
We ponder the appropriate attire for this upscale event.

Artur scouts out the secondary location. He also knows how the book is stored normally: in a locked room, inside of which is a safe, both of which are controlled by key.

The book will be sold sometime between 1300-1400. It'll be brought up into L1 cache shortly before 1300. The thieves assuredly know this, so they must remove the book before then.

Our options:
- remove the book from the vaults before the auction
- yoink it as it's brought up, after stopping the other thieves
- yoink it from L1 cache, after stopping the other thieves
- hijack the theft

Question: how are we going to the auction?
- as Mme Arlette's representatives; she has one good suit to loan out for this
	- will be expected to be in the auction hall, bidding.
- get hired as staff. benefit: token for the lower rooms, drawback: observation/scrutiny, expected to actually work. also kinda sus
- get hired as auxiliary staff (catering etc). less observation, no token.
- impersonate some other guest
Artur already works there. Haskell will try to get hired as auxiliary staff. Bendren goes as Mme Arlette's proxy. Yala gets herself hired as proper auction staff.

Plan:
Sigil the book w/ Artur's ring ahead of time, as a backup plan. (done)
The day of: let the thieves bring the book to the secondary location. Ring of sigils finds out where they put it.
Yala goes there invisibly, grabs the book, puts it in a sack and puts that under an *invisible item*. She passes it to Haskell, who deposits it in a dumpster or similar outside. Later we retrieve it from there.
If the thieves fail, we can use the ring of sigils plus auction-winner records to yoink it from the buyer.

Artur successfully talks his way into getting brief access to the book, and manages to plant a sigil on it. The vaults on basement-0 and basement-1 aren't divinationproof.

Level of security: we know, roughly, how well-guarded this all will be. Details TBD by Mink.
