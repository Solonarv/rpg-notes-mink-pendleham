Pendleham harbor is now blockaded, and land routes are also cut off.

Houses are falling apart from the plague, not quickly (houseflesh is resilient) but there is dilapidation and more fragile things like doors are not working

symptoms on people: fever, bloody coughing, bleeding from eyes, sometimes aggression. NOT a zombie plague

food prices going up due to blockade

Our reactions to this (two weeks of downtime):
- Haskell: he's been selling antiplague at exorbitant prices, making bank
	- earn income is, appropriately, a crit success on level 5 task: 2 gp/day -> 28 gp
- Artur: not going out in public searching for info as much, trying to keep his movements low to reduce infection risk.
	- retrain something to know more about diseases
- Yala: gathering people's experiences and writing articles about them, trying contrived ways of interviewing people (sign languages, message spells, etc) to reduce infection risk
	- task level 5 success, 0.9 gp/day -> 12.6 gp

Mink designs the mechanics effects of this disease live :)
ok he's done, it's bad (:>)
current stages: Haskell 1, Yala 3, Artur 4. We all succeed the save and don't get worse.
disease is level 13 (counteract rank 7) and also a curse

cost of living for slumming it in our lab: 6 sp/week, by GM fiat

Still during downtime, Artur attempts to learn *cleanse affliction*:
- it works! -6gp

Cleanse affliction cast once on himself and Yala, reducing stages to:
- Haskell 1 (no cast, it would be useless)
- Yala 2
- Artur 3

Message from Mme Arlette: she has a job for us.
- invites us to her parlor, to chat.
- you must've noticed food prices rising (Yala: yeah thats why I moved out)
- this cant continue. Im looking for sources of food, our own aubergines are helping but I do still usually 
- find me a goat.
- Y: a goat?
- not just any goat, a special goat
- specially modified to produce an incredible amount of milk
- was supposed to be delivered to her, but shipment was stolen just before it was supposed to be delivered - which was yesterday.
- need you to get it back, in pristine condition. Ideally also kill whoever took it from me.


info? leads?
- address of warehouse in port where the goat was stored in a cage before delivery
- she sent an armed guard after it (yesterday) because duh. just marching through the streets, it would get stolen.
- but by the time the guards got there, the goat was gone - there had been a breakin
- goat was smuggled in from outside the city and was supposed to be delivered yesterday.

payment: 50L of milk on delivery (each)
Yala is surprised, Mme Arlette explains: food prices predicted to increase even more, this just makes sense.

our first stop is the warehouse. Artur and Yala retch to clear their sickened condition, down eagle eye elixirs provided by Haskell, and Artur's vision is unimpaired enough to work.

warehouse is easy enough to reach, a little off the big street. doors are just ripped off the hinges, seems to be deserted.

searching the warehouse:
- this was an abandoned warehouse being used as a dropoff point for clandestine dealings, smuggled goods
- seems like a lot of people came through recently. Yala manages to pick their tracks apart: at least 4 different groups
	- one group goes to a corner of the warehouse
	- second group comes in later, some kind of scuffle, maybe with group 3
	- also a third group, came in through a window
	- fourth group that came in way later, presumably found nothing, and left
- scorch marks and other battle damage from the fight
- also some blood trails from people not in the best of health
	- group 2 or 3
- position of the cage (based on dust not covering the floor where the cage was) indicates it was probably taken by group 2 or 3

we arbitrarily pick one of the four group 2/3 trails...
- leads into the docks, shadier parts (now even shadier because of the plague)
	- blood trail a little hard to follow, but we do it very well
	- come across dilapidated building
	- has armed, unfriendly looking people standing around it
	- not dressed super great, so probably not a fleshsmithing lab.
	- they have tattoos of a red snake, indicates a specific gang (one of like a dozen snake-themed gangs)
	- Yala is greeted by one of them who asks what she wants from the Red Snake Gang
		- Yala just point blank explains that were looking for some stolen shit, did they have anything to do with that?
		- at some point she mentions it's a goat we're looking for, was stolen from that warehouse
		- this gets them all excited, a goat? holy shit
		- she asks to chat to the boss
		- while he's gone, she chats up the other guards, manages to confirm that some of them did hear about something happening on that night, also some of them got sick, really not in good shape
			- between the lines: was a big thing last night, bunch of people came back injured
			- couple other gangs could've been involved, boss keeping it close to chess:
				- (some gang names)
		- boss arrives: giant of a man, 2.5m tall, hands as thick as his torso, almost trapezoid shaped body. has clearly been in a fight recently, based on some superficial wounds.
		- yala explains we're looking for the goat that was stolen by one of the four groups that hit the warehouse
			- boss immediately says it was the green armadillos, and flies into a tirade of insults about them
				- seems to be honest?
			- this goes on for a while
			- Yala has a suggestion: you hate these guys, and you're saying they have our goat - we could rough them up a little, if you tell us where to find them?
				- however if you're fucking with us it's you we'll be roughing up
					- he's entirely unthreatened and finds this hilarious
					- he actually pats yala on the head (rude!)
			- no idea whether he actually has the goat (too distracted by the humiliation of headpats)
			- he does tell us where to find the green armadillos
				- he doesn't think we can actually win, but he doesn't actually care about our safety
- green armadillos are holed up in giant building complex of a warehouse, many walkways, up up down etc, convoluted path through this complex to reach the center.
	- as we head there, we spot just a few armadillos, they're all cloaked and masked and stealthy.
	- one does come out and greet us. wtf do you want?
		- Y: a little bird told me you have a goat, any truth to that?
		- we have everything, can find whatever you need! (this is just marketing speak but they do actually have the goat)
		- Y: fantastic, we'll take it!
		- he names a price, 5000 gp
		- Yala asks if they could budge on this, they guy says we'd have to talk to the boss, Yala says sure and he goes away
		- while he's gone, we discuss a plan to maybe bargain for the goat with medical services
	- guy comes back out of the door of one of the buildings, with a smaller figure (presumably the boss?), pulls back their hood- it's the woman Haskell shoved off a ledge that one time!
		- she's clearly unhappy to see him
		- H: ma'am, you would've done the same and you know it!
			- she stares at him and goes fair enough
		- she goes: ok, you can have the goat, you just gotta beat this guy (haskell) half to death?
		- alternate proposal: medical services? Yala and Artur jazz up his *cleanse affliction* spellcasting
			- sure, that can pay for the rest of the goat
		- Haskell doesn't seem too put out by the idea, but notes that he can't/won't provide them antiplague until he's better
			- she doesn't care
		- Yala notes that neither she nor Artur are the physical type
			- the boss motions for lead pipes to be provided to us
		- Haskell eggs us on, we do it
			- he loses some teeth
			- at 1 HP and -5 to all rolls
		- boss points out: how are you gonna transport the goat?
		- fortunately she doesn't mind haskell getting patched up immediately

tentative plan: make the goat invisible, still in its cage, and transport it through the streets undetected
- haskell has to heal up first, which hopefully won't take too long
- haskell plots revenge against this woman
