NB: many things discussed over the preceding weeks.

introductions

going over voted questions

schedule confirmed every 2 weeks, exactly

puzzles: 'typical' puzzles are not liked by mink, logistics challenges and such preferred. result: votes changed to 'mostly yes'.

tech: more victorian than pseudomedieval

currency:
- gold econ for food, housing, mundane services
- flesh parts and such for flesh and magic

setting: City of Pendleham, see setting doc

factions:
Imperial Guard, remnant of imperial authority. sorta like cops but not really
Fleshsmiths, might control individual districts, run something like a gang in the district
Traders/smugglers, who use the city because there's not really a central authority, especially illegal goods
Travelers who just pass through because the city is on a river/coast, i.e. a major travel artery. Used to be more, but still kinda there.
Big Hospital, still treats outsiders, distinction: solo fleshsmiths vs hospital, used to be center of medical learning. collapsing, many of its former fleshsmith doctors have broken away to go independent.
Repair Guys, guys who repair/maintain the city

biological trains, like metros

newspapers: exist (as does printing press), kinda freeform. either under the sway/protection of one of the factions or another powerful figure, or small, secretive, independent

fleshsmith fiefdoms are somewhat unstable, shifting occasionally (months, not weeks) but this doesnt have huge impact on common people

food: three main sources
1. import (by ship). was big in the imperial days, but now less since the city is poorer.
2. nearby farms. most were previously dedicated to fleshsmithing production, i.e. specialty crops for use in the city, but also food.
3. some also inside the city. not unusual to have a little roof garden with, for example, eggplant (plant which makes eggs).

lots of people in pendleham at least partly modified. compare to upgrades in cyberpunk (games/series).

player stuff:

useful to have a fixer. informal vote: yeah we'll have a fixer.

character ideas:

Dab— witch, used to be researcher: going around, gathering info, including in dungeons, accompanying proper adventurers as well. specifically interested in old magical knowledge. patron: not open about them. personal motivation: knowledge (esp. magical) should be more freely shared, not hoarded.

Mug­— alchemist, used to be rly good when younger, but incautious. fucked up and fleshwarped himself. main motivation: i just need to find the right obscure miracle potion to fix myself (surely this will not end badly). gathering lots of info and secrets on fleshwarping and fleshsmithing. mechanically: frontliner.

QT— catfolk swashbuckler. had a cousin who moved here, years back when empire still working, super successful. came here when things collapsed, found that cousin was kinda lying, got kinda stuck in the city when plague hit. was supposed to get help from cousin, now on hard times because cousin turned out blowhard.

Tortilla— cleric, undertaker. idea: how does this tie into pendleham? a little hardened, grizzled, been doing this a while. what he does gives him a very good view of how the city is falling apart.

Jace— kitsune swash. bright-eyed dude, heard of mcguffin from pendleham (tall tales). absolutely believes in {specific mcguffin}, goes to pendleham to find it. bright and happy, a little klepto, tricksy prankster. from the same region as QT's.

Solo— wizard. investigative reporter of a sort, here to dig into how pendleham's situation affects the common people and also maybe some arcane secrets on the side.

Outsiders: QT, Jace, Dab, Solo (probably)
Pendlehamites: Mug, Tortilla

Starting level: 2

free archetype: 4 yes, 2 ambivalent, 0 no => enabled.

player power: how do the PCs grow so fast?
idea: some kind of modification to the body that allows for this explosive growth
idea 2: ignore it entirely
idea 3: more downtime to stretch out the growth
consensus: downtime!

city plagued and quarantined: campaign start shortly before quarantine

party size reduction is needed. RNG says goodbye Jace.

connections: Dab-Mug

Tortilla's: not mercenary, not particularly holy. 

Madame Arlette, an Aubergista. Runs an auberga, a hostel for people from outside the city; a place that's safe from gangs and some of the city's horrros. On the side, is an information broker, has space for well-off people to meet and discuss things. So she serves as a middle(wo)man if someone needs something stolen, or an old lab delved into for something left behind, etc.

Solo- decided to stay at her hostel, on Tortilla's recommendation
QT- was planning to stay with cousin but he's a blowhard, so stayed at Madame Arlette's hostel instead.
Dab- outsider, also staying there.
Mug- Madam A put him into contact with Dab.
Tortilla- Madam A has him take care of bodies sometimes, when they need gotten rid of.

Dab&Mug previously: looking for the same thing (book), Mug yoinking it out from under Dab's nose, Dab later got it disseminated.

Tortilla&Solo: Solo has a relative in the same church as Tort; said relative recommended Tort as first point of contact in Pendleham.

QT's cousin works as an assistant to Tortilla; really overestimated the prestige of that position.

D&M's book later caused a scandal, which Solo investigated and found D&M at the root of; published some articles about the whole thing.

Mug met QT's cousin at the hospital school (which teaches fleshsmithing, but only the basics).
