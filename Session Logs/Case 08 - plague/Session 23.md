(we spend some time restoring the encounter state)

combat continues.
- ROUND 8
- Artur: stand. leap across alley. stride away from zombies.
- Yala: fruitlessly scrabble at the wall.
- Haskell: quick alch a hippogriff in a jar. 2⋄ use it (ready to be mounted next turn)
- civilians: irrelevant
- zombies, all chasing after artur: drop down ledge to purple level. get up. three leap across, one of them chasing after artur and getting in one attack (28 hit for ow 12 s). more zombies shuffle and jump around.
- ROUND 9
- Artur: attempt to climb up to green level; success, ~~fail~~fail, fail.
- Yala: 3⋄ blazing bolt, killing two zombies and injuring the one next to Artur (also ending her invisibility).
- Haskell: mount hippogriff. {it flies over to green ledge near artur}. dismount. drop rope for artur.
- zombies:
	- attack Artur: miss, miss, miss.
	- move and attack artur: miss, miss
	- move and climb toward artur.
- ROUND 10
- Artur: creep up the wall a little, but not making it far.
- Yala: 3⋄ force barrage at the zombie she blazing bolted, it explodes.
- Haskell: move above Artur. raise shield. reach down to lend a hand to artur for climbing up.
- zombies:
	- zombie next to artur: tries to climb up but falls back down, then scrambles back up most of the way
	- alley zombie: falls down, crit succeeds, succeeds, ending up on purple ledge.
- ROUND 11
- Artur: climb up onto green ledge with haskell. 2⋄ Command: Drop, the zombie is unaffected (despite failing the save).
- Yala: RK: how are these zombies' reflexes?- pretty good. 2⋄ needle darts at the zombie nearest to artur, which kills it.
- Haskell: climb up toward red with contemptuous ease. drop a rope.
- zombie: trying to climb, makes it 10ft up.
- ROUND 12
- Artur: climb up to Haskell's level thanks to the rope.
- Yala: 2⋄ needle darts the last zombie by Artur and Haskell, it doesn't quite die. 1⋄ feet of floating up to blue level.
- Haskell: idk i was distracted
- zombies:
	- the one by haskell&artur climbs after them
	- more zombies, now done eating civilians, wander around and spot Yala.
- ROUND 13
- Artur: 2⋄ telekinetic projectile @ friend zombie, crit, super dead. start climbing.
- Yala: 2⋄ entangling flora to slow down the pursuing zombie(s), stride toward yellow ledge.
- Haskell: start climbing, succeed, land on yellow level. drop a rope.
- civilian begs Artur for help, tries to grab him so he doesn't abandon her (succeeds).
- zombies wandering around.
	- most can't see us. one newly spots Yala, and plummets down to chase after her.
	- one that was already after Yala escapes, starts climbing.
- ROUND 14
- Artur: wriggle out of the civilian's grasp. climb up to blue level. move toward Haskell.
- Yala: climb, get 10ft up.
- Haskell: move above Artur & civilian, dangle rope for Artur's benefit.
- civilian: climbs ok
- zombies:
	- converging on Yala uh oh
	- one gets scary close
- ROUND 15
- Artur: climb up to yellow ledge with Haskell, start running.
- Yala: FINALLY makes it up the yellow ledge, and *zoop* she's out
- Haskell: pull up the rope, runrunrun away.

finally we escape

we reconvene at our lab to scrub off, and also scrape off some of the stuff that got on us for use as samples.

Haskell analyzes the samples, and quickly produces some healing items for the party. Artur and Yala, while resting up, start to feel a little sick, as if exposed to something.

Yala crafts face masks for herself and Artur so they're less likely to spread whatever they've caught.

Yala & Artur take the train to go meet up with the university and the researchers again. The guards are a bit surprised to see us masked, Yala's explanation that it's fine, we're just being careful seems to be rather unconvincing. The guard runs off to go get someone,

Zzzze shows up and Yala gives them a quick overview of what we found, including the dead guy, and what happened.

He comes back with a big syringe to draw some blood, which Yala and Artur acquiesce to. We're then kicked off the campus and told to stay away until told otherwise. We do get paid also.

We go back to the lab, where Yala at least intends to stay for the next few days (until she's got a better idea of how sick/infectious she is).

Yala helps Artur learn *befuddle*.

Over the next few weeks:
- the disease continues spreading, nobody's sure how exactly. perhaps escaped zombies biting people, perhaps some other mechanism
- fort saves vs disease:
	- Yala 29, Artur 26, Haskell 22. Meaning TBD.
- Blue Concordance researchers start sounding alarms, messages getting sent out. About 2 weeks after our adventure, they declare a blockade of Pendleham: nothing goes in, nothing goes out.
