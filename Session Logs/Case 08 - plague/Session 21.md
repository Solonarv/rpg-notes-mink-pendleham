Haskell is brought up to speed.

We consider whether Artur's sigil ring could be useful for tracking the beast:
- 10 minute cooldown
- 5 mile radius
- gives general direction

delivery brainbeasts might have a fleshpouch or a backpack, in general. the ones delivering the samples are using little backpacks, but have no recognizable logo (which is typical, to avoid leaking information to thieves).

we plan to wait for the next delivery, and Artur will apply a *sigil* to the brainbeast so we can track it - but they've been coming once a day, and today's delivery already occurred early in the morning.

since we'd otherwise be wasting the day, we decide to go check on that place in the walled city where Tergarlo supposedly lives/works.

walled city is not exactly a brick, more of a mix between shantytown / built-up neighborhood. has canyon-streets through it with many bridges crossing them. we stand out, look out of place: our clothes too good, our bodies too healthy and well-fed. this earns us some unfriendly glances, but nobody actually goes for us.

Yala finds the place fairly easily. Tergarlo does small-scale magic item auctions sometimes, has clients coming in with lore questions, etc. Has a sign above his house, pretty easy to see. It's built into the wall of this giant housing complex, a bit hard to say where his house begins and others end, but it appears to be a nice place. Also seems to be locked up, lights out, door closed. nobody answers the knock on the door.

neighbors:
- window grandma, who retreats when spotted

Yala goes to knock on the window.

gma hasnt seen him in a couple days at least. he'd been looking sick for a while now, going to some doctor, but a couple days ago he stopped coming back. which doctor? gma doesnt know, but does know roughly which direction he went in to see that doctor, and that the doctor was in the walled city. She is/was friendly with Tergarlo and he was friendly with the neighborhood. Grandma's name is Sarah. further doctor specifics: no. She worries for him, being gone so long with no word, and suggests we look inside his house - something she wouldn't normally condone but Yala looks so trustworthy!

Yala, being the fastest, runs off to buy a thieves' toolkit, which she finds quickly and with no problems. (1x kit, 2x replacement picks; 3.6 gp total, paid by Artur)

Artur downs a quicksilver mutagen from Haskell's brewery prior to picking the lock on Tergarlo's home, which obediently opens.

The home is not very large: bedroom, office, kitchen/livingspace, all pretty nicely done up but not the kind of place someone expects to stay forever, rather a place someone stays while they're working.

Yala looks for, and finds, some documents
pay slips, finance tracking sheets, and the man's diary (mostly written in code).
diary does mention having to deal with this one guy for the sample, in an obviously annoyed tone: has to pay the guy a lot
also seems to be in some sort of debt
do get a name for the doctor: Zander

little of value in the house other than the documents, as if Tergarlo expected a break-in; no valuables, jewelry, artifacts, etc, even though he dealt in those. (Artur gets an elixir of life to offset the damage from the quicksilver mutagen).

we take the diary with us but leave the other stuff, relocking on our way out.

Yala knocks on Grandma Sarah's window again, asking if the name Zander means anything to her. It does: he's this doctor, has a clinic somewhere in the walled city. it's a sort-of-charity: he charges poor people less and rich people more, so poor people can still get some treatment. She doesn't know anything about the debt or other financial trouble he seemed to be in.

Yala looks for information about Zander, heading vaguely in the indicated direction, and the trickle of sickly people makes it easy enough to find.

It's at the very bottom layer of the walled city, really dug in there. There's only directly-overhead sunlight, coming through the narrow street-canyon. We catch some looks from people surprised to see us come in.

There is no line, but there are some groups of sick people sitting nearby. coughing, pale faces, drooling, rubbing eyes.

We enter. The sight inside is heart-sroppingly bleak:

long room, many cots with sick and dying people along the walls, haphazardly pushed up against the walls and each other, leaving only a narrow corridor down the middle. Way in the back is a door heading deeper, no visible staff attending to the sick.

Quick vibe check: some of the sick inside obviously have different issues (one guy clearly has a broken leg for example), some of them appear to have similar issues to the people outside

Yala picks the most alert-looking patient to talk to, which is actually the guy with the broken leg.

Y- there dont seem to be any doctors/nurses around, this normal?
guy- they're busy, been waiting half an hour
Y- seen any at all in that time?
guy- no
Y- been here before?
guy lives close by, fell down. he does visit this clinic occasionally.
are visitors allowed past those big doors at the end? he doesn't know.

Yala talks to a few more patients, many are in bad shape or too distrustful to talk, but some do chat.
seen doctor go in the back a couple hours ago, a few more people went in after him, but nobody came back out so far.

fuckit. into the doors. Behind is another room with just as many patients, and beyond that is another door opening onto a corridor with many doors. there are sounds of shouting from further down. hard to make out, but seems like two people shouting at each other, one asking for something and the other replying that there is nothing.

Yala sneaks closer to eavesdrop better. can make out a bit more: one guy is asking for more treatment, presumably for his condition, seems to be coughing a lot. other guy is saying no, there is no more, if you want more you would have to pay for it, and you've already gotten everything.

suddenly, second voice stops, snorts, don't have time for this - have to get back to work, starts walking away. first voice tries to hurry after him, but descends into great coughing fit, cant hear anything else. eventually coughing dies down into just wheezing.

Yala returns to the second room, waits ~half an hour to see if a doctor shows up.

while Yala is doing all this...
- Artur tries to crack Tergarlo's diary
	- not a super complicated cipher for recent notes, perhaps he was in a hurry
	- was working with Zander to collect samples
		- not clear which direction the money was moving between them
		- he was getting something out of it (the samples?)
		- something happened (coded harder, unclear)
		- got angrier and angrier with Zander
		- starts mentioning disease
		- progresses quickly; describes symptoms: red eyes, worsening vision, coughing, difficulty breathing, spasms
- Haskell has just been standing around like a lump, since he knows he's bad at talking and he doesn't want to risk infecting himself by interacting with the patients

Yala goes back in there looking to find the doctor. Instead she finds the wheezing/coughing guy, now a corpse. To her surprise, looking at his face, this is Tergarlo! Face white, blood dripping from mouth and nostrils, a very sorry sight. She presses on looking for the doctor.

As she proceeds inward, she eventually enters what seems like a laboratory. There is a guy strapped to a table, unconscious, with tubes plugged into him. There's a guy in a plague doctor getup looming over him, who looks at Yala and asks who she is.

She quickly introduces herself and states why she's here: looking into Tergarlo's disappearance and the rumors of the disease spreading to humans, partly out of personal curiosity and partly on behalf of the Blue Concordance researchers

mentioning the concordance and this disease, the guy gets twitchy. 

Yala tries to reassure him and get him to not brush her off, to no great success. He starts edging towards some vials of comically glowing toxic green substances; Yala makes some excuses about letting him finish his operation and leaving, we'll wait outside.

He doesn't agree with Yala leaving and goes to tip over one of these vials. Yala legs it, and manages to escape the noxious gas this releases.

She bursts out the doors, shouting for everyone to get out to escape the gas. The crowd of patients is a bit slow to react, but once fumes start to visibly leak through, they get the idea. People start to GTFO.

sprinkler system comes on, not any kind of acid or obvious toxin, but it does smell funny. One person Yala is moving, who has the same sort of symptoms, twitches a bit more, coming alive, eyes open, but not really conscious.

As we step out the doors, we hear several explosions. the neighborhood has many ladders, bridges, etc connecting levels. One ladder at the end of the little alley we're in just explodes, a rope bridge above us collapses after a support explodes. People start poking their heads out of windows, wondering what's happening.

We notice several of these sick people sniffing at us, their eyes glaze over and their looks become decisively bad. The guy Yala was carrying starts snarling at her, looking like a bite risk.

every layed is 15ft up, yellow is the top.

disease exposure tracker:
- Yala 1/?
- Artur 1/?
- Haskell 1/?
NB: the ominous gas cloud would've been a lot of exposure

seek can check 3 creatures for "disease zombie? y/n"

initiative!.. next time
