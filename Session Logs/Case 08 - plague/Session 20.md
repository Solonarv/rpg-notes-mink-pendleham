time fast-forward, about 2 months

city events:
- fleshsmths much more active throughout city after island burning
	- not exactly looking for dissidents
	- city did become "calmer"
	- people on alert
	- fleshsmiths keeping a tighter grip
- city itself decaying a bit more, the eye sickness in the alley of sight spreads and is mutating
	- some buildings's maintenance mechanisms fail
	- some outright rotting in place
	- various fleshsmiths found some patchwork solutions
		- specific to their areas
	- no general solution/cure though.
- Yala earn income: 21 (for the whole period)
	- time split between:
		- writing articles, kinda critical of fleshsmiths, largely referencing their burning of the island
		- research into spells
		- crafting stuff
	- one day when returning home, finds her door unlocked
		- decides not to go in, has heard some bad rumors about her articles
		- turns out someone did sneak in, left a bomb there
		- afterwards Mme Arlette tightens security and this doesn't happen again
- Artur looks into rumors of magical knowledge
	- gather information: diplomacy 21
	- lots of rumors floating around, not clear what's true or false
	- one place mentioned often, though not in any coherent way
		- a particular section of the city, where buildings are kinda on top of each other
			- kowloon walled city
		- spirit sighting near this place
		- small black market for magical artefacts, also in this place
		- yala also hears of this during fleshsmith research, rumors about this illness
			- manufactured?
			- weapon that went out of control?
			- what if it jumps to humans?
			- last couple weeks: rumors that this has happened in KWC, but no evidence.
				- city authorities are just ignoring this.
- church of the dead god got big influx of followers
	- they were already talking about city falling apart, all this corruption - and now it's literally falling apart, even faster than before; so now their message resonates a lot better
- university got a burst of new blood
	- had been having a problem where many prestigious scholars had fled the city, brain drain problems
	- recently, because of this big fleshsmith battle and mysterious diseases, some new scholars arrived, looking into it, leading to more activity in the university
- Mme Arlette's place is doing fine, slowly getting reinforced/fortified
	- she is satisfied that the city got peaceful for a while, but there is clearly an uneasy mood in the air, so she has been preparing for the other shoe to drop: stockpiling resources etc
- Arrissanne credit:
	- base had about 2000 people
	- about 1600 of them died
	- about 80% of that is credited to us
	- resulting in about 6400 gold of credit (1600 each if split four ways)
	- we handle this within a week since that's how long arrissanne keeps credit
	- we have some big powerful items now

our lines of research both lead us to the same man, Galint Tergarlo, either lives in the KWC or spends a lot of time there. his name just keeps coming up.

Yala decides to start by asking around the walled city about this guy. The place is hard to navigate, being a 3D environment, and the people there aren't super friendly - it's one of the worse places to live in the city, barely better than the sewers. But she does manage to learn some stuff and put a picture together
this guy lives/works at {directions to a place}, which is deep inside. he appears to be some kind of merchant, middleman, buys stuff from people who get it from various places and re-sells it (heavily implied to be a fence).

Artur asks around in the university circles. He has better luck than Yala, and finds a group of people who have pretty direct dealings with Tergarlo. They're scholars of this disease spreading through the town, and have been contacting him to get them samples from various places. They have a little office/faculty/base in the university, which Artur visits:
tents set up outside one of the main uni buildings, partly for easier access to facilities and partly because it's hard to find (safe!) housing for outsiders in Pendleham, so they hope to be safe by camping on the campus.

they're a delegation from outside the city, representing one of the other governments (obvious from their flags). they seem a bit isolated from the rest of the campus by how their tents huddle against the main building.

Blue Concordate: one of the Empire's successor states. their territories kind of hug Pendleham, they're on the coast to the left and also upriver (to the right is a different country). this affords them some influence over Pendleham but it's still mostly an independent city.

relatively democratic confederation but also pretty isolationist, got a nationalist bent to their governance after the Empire fell: "we're here, everyone else can drown for all we care".
fairly ok in terms of interacting with other people

kinda negative views on fleshsmithing, but it's a complicated topic. after empire dissolution, fleshsmithing got the blame for a lot of the empire's misdeeds, but the concordate does rely on some of the products pendleham produces, so some forces are more friendly towards fleshsmiths. overall vibe still negative, but not as strongly as it used to be.

views on magic: neutral, no specific views.

these guys, being academics (who decided to come to Pendleham to investigate a fleshsmithing-related disease), would naturally have different opinions from the general public

Artur's approach: just ask these nerds about their special interest

their camp has an obvious entrance, which is guarded - although the guards aren't armed/enhanced to Pendleham standards. they eye us warily as we approach, and ask what our business is. we introduce ourselves as fellow academics, looking to converse with the academics here. They accept this and send us toward the central tent, where we can find Zezeze.

The central tent appears to be some kind of planning/meeting room with maps of the city on the walls criss-crossed with lines. They make no sense to Yala, but Artur can see that these are tracking the progression of the disease through the city. The shorthand takes a bit to figure out but he gets the hang of it well enough.

The tent is indeed occupied. One person notices us first: they seem mostly humanoid, but they have the head of a bee, and approach us alongside their human assistant.
bee people: mostly live in the Concordate, don't really leave it much. They have some kind of queen, and she has some relationship to all people in the society. It's pretty obscure and they don't talk of it to outsiders much. They were kinda neutral on the whole empire collapse thing and mostly stayed out of it.

The bee buzzes at us. Their assistant translates: who are we? We introduce ourseves:
- Artur Mordane, traveling researcher, looks into anything that catches his eye. Any interesting knowledge or methodology they can bring, perhaps foreign to these parts.

The bee nods and buzzes some more. Their assistant says it's always nice to meet a fellow academic, what's your specialty? Artur: occult rituals, ancient magics, that sort of thing. Also dabbled in fleshsmithing, arcane magics, smattering of other topics.

Bzzbzbz. That's a very broad set of fields! We're doing research into the condition afflicting the city, perhaps you can speak to one of our interns- ZZze is a bit busy ATM. Artur notices that the assistant was much more polite than the bee probably was.

Yala belatedly introduces herself as well
mention of jump to humans alerts the bee. They seem much more interested now. Assistant eventually nods: that's exactly what they're researching here, but it's been hard to 
Depressing as it is, he's actually been one of the more helpful people - getting samples from the walled city district is extremely difficult otherwise, but frankly we've been doubting the authenticity of his samples.
he's also been missing for about a week now
we've still been getting samples though. they've been delivered by creature couriers. we believe he has some kind of sample collection, perhaps on the roof of this walled city
we'd be more than happy to pay you for info on where he might be found, or any evidence about human transmission of this disease.
Y: I was already thinking about going to find this guy so it seems our goals line up.
Artur 
Yala asks: btw do you know sign language? Assistant explains: asking if someone knows ISL is pretty rude in the Concordate. Y (signing and speaking at the same time, as she happens to speak blue concordate SL as well)- sorry, slipped my mind. is this better? it is, and the assistant (being no longer needed) goes away.
bee seems pleased by this, though still unimpressed.

we hash out some details via sign, with Yala translating for Artur's benefit.

Tergarlo was supposed to show up to a meeting with them and didn't, but the samples keep coming. if he's missing, who's sending the samples? NB: they paid in advance.

we consider our plans: perhaps we can track one of the delivery beasts and figure out where they're coming from
