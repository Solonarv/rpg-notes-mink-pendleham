Haskell is busy retching in a corner, but manages to pop out an elixir of life to revive Bendren before he does so. (note: Haskell's player is absent for this session)

we start interrogating Letek aka green cloak.

- Yala (paraphrased): why were you even trying to stop us?? you didn't seem to have a problem when we talked earlier
- Letek feigns panicked confusion, pretends not to even know us.
- Yala: ok new plan, we're asking the others.
- Letek, extra panicky: nonono don't tell them
- Yala: sure whatever, explain why you were trying to stop us.
- Letek continues waffling and panicking
- Artur figures out there is probably something fucked up he did, except it's actually two things and he doesn't want to admit to either.
- Artur: look, we're not the vengeful sort. we're not going to share this info, we just want what we came for. we just want to know why you attacked us.
- Letek doesn't seem to buy it.
- Bendren: look, in this city nobody cares about some guy living in the sewers, so long as you don't touch the wrong levers.
- Letek isn't convinced, but Bendren can tell this isn't what Letek is concerned about. Letek thinks it's something more serious than that.
- Artur tries again to explain that we really have no intent to spread this info.
- Letek: in this city of lies, you're the last honorable person? you're really not going to spread it around if I did something horrible?
- Artur: yeah
- Letek: and your companions, can I trust them?
- Artur: yes
- Letek: ok fine. im a bit of a fleshsmith, the others don't know. I actually got into that lab some time ago. We have a lot of people coming and going, I may have at some point... knocked somebody on the head, brought them over, did some stuff, can sell them. He explains that he's kidnapped a number of people and experimented on them in this secret lab of his. Also why do you even want that lab?
- Artur: looking for some notes in there, from the previous owner.
- Letek: oh I can get you writings, I kept everything.

He can either lead us to the lab through some ventilation shafts, or he can go in and bring us the notes. We all decide we want to see the lab, and he doesn't betray us! yay! but the path is circuitous and takes a good 20 minutes, which lets us see his inhuman flexibility adapted to crawling through these narrow shafts.

The lab is not very big, a vault for the architect's blueprints and designs. Walls covered in shelves, surgery tables in the middle with the corpse of a guy that Letek is adding arms and removing/adding other organs to. In the corner is storage for various body parts, several corpses there in various states of disassembly.

He shows us one of the shelves, where all the writings are. Artur starts looking through it and easily finds the notes Prof. Mink wanted. An extensive discussion of ferret stink follows; Artur understands what the device is trying to do. It's a cleanroom airlock, but for ferrets that can be sent in instead of the humanoid lab worker for working with dangerous substances. The device cleans off the various toxins and contaminants that may remain on the ferret, and also deodorizes it. Artur gets an idea for adapting the devices to work on humanoids instead

We ponder what to do with Letek (at first, out of character). Authorities might arrest and jail him, or accept payment from him and let him go. We agree that we can't simply let him continue, but we're also reluctant to simply kill him, or to simply inform the community down here of what he's been doing (which would basically be equivalent to killing him).

Artur's assessment of Letek's talent as a fleshsmith: he's reasonably talented, could probably get into the university especially if vouched for. We think Prof. Mink might be pleased if we said "got your notes, also found you an assistant", especially if said assistant was reasonably skilled at mustelid fleshsmithing.

We call Letek back.  He still has his arms tied behind his back, but this doesn't seem to bother him too much. He asks what we've decided to take; Yala makes him pale with a snappy line: "You", but quickly deflates the threat.

Artur asks if Letek's ever considered the athenaeum. He has, but he's never thought he could get in. Artur explains that he has an in with a professor; how does Letek feel about mustelids? Letek is confused and has no particular opinion, why? - Artur: the professor's speciality is mustelids. Letek seems open to it, but it could be a bit of a tough sell since he also has no particular interest or expertise. Artur suggests studying the notes we were hired to retrieve so Letek can impress Prof. Mink with that. At first the lecture doesn't go too well, but Artur switches tracks and starts talking about pipes; turns out Letek and ferrets have a lot in common, both of them really like to crawl through pipes. This works exceptionally well.

We leave the lab, and we announce to the rest of the community that Letek is leaving for the university; he promises he'll come back here to help people, and seems incredibly giddy and happy at the opportunity.

As soon as we exit the sewers, Yala prestidigitates everyone as clean as possible, then we head into some public baths to wash up properly (Yala pays for Letek's entry).

We then go to find Prof. Mink, but he's not available today. We buy Letek some clothes and a room at Mme Arlette's (totaling 4sp, Artur pays), and we note that he's had long-ago experience with such luxuries, but not recent.

He's clearly nervous and wondering why we're being so generous to him, but doesn't ask.

The next day, we go to meet Prof. Mink, all of us together. Prof. Mink asks if we got his notes, and who's this guy? Artur explains that we do have his notes, and we also met this guy, who has a keen interest in mustelids, and some skill as a fleshsmith. Artur and Yala working together hype up Letek's skills, and the man himself joins in, showing off his newfound enormous interest in ferrets. A critical mass of Special Interest: Ferrets is reached, a danger to the sanity of everyone around. We flee the scene, with Prof. Mink's thanks.
