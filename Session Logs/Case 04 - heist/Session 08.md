we know the layout

The thieves will bring the book to Storage 1 temporarily (cyan X on the map)

last-minute prep
- Bendren: have acceptable weapons ready, his hammer is totally a religious accessory
- Yala: prepare the right spells, make sure she didn't forget to bring a sack
- Artur: pay attention to the layout of hallways etc. One of the ways the secret basement is guard is fleshsmithed dogs that live in the walls, which seem to fall sick (lethargic) around this time.
- Haskell: hide Flamelli directly on his body.

Morning:

three of us work here already.

Bendren gets a loaner carriage from Mme Arlette, it's built into a spider. His outfit very clearly indicates his religious affiliation. Lots of black and white. Long coat, white shirt. No hat, hair neatly slicked back.

He spots a famliar face: Dr. Derwin Brickell, and greets her. He asks if she's after anything in particular: there's some second-hand equipment from another fleshsmith's lab, which would be good as business has been a bit thin lately. Soon, they're called to the auction house.

Yala does a pretty good job keeping things running smoothly, and gets noticed by a higher-up manager for this.

Yala goes upstairs to handle the auction items. (idea: she and Artur swap later, giving Yala justification to be down)

Portly auction announcer gives a little speech. Clearly (to Bendren) trying to inflate the historical significance of the event. Bidding begins, with buyers going in and out of the auction hall proper; walking around, visiting the bar, or just bidding. Bendren enters the bar, where he notices a woman arguing with one of the staff, shouting about the drinks being bad, to profuse apologies. Specifically, she's angry that the drinks on offer aren't hard enough; she came here to be entertained by the bar while she waits for her painting auction to resolve. She eventually escalates, demanding access to the back to see whether the staff are hiding any of the good stuff.

Bendren asks her about the painting? but she doesn't seem to care, just continues making a scene shouting about the drinks. Bendren asks the bartender why there's no hard liquor here; the bartender tries to answer privately, but the woman is not having it. The bartender explains that they simply don't want angry-drunk guests, which sends the woman into a furor.

The bartender eventually relents, but asks Bendren to accompany them as he doesn't want to let just one guest downstairs. Bendren accepts, seeing the fear in the bartender's eyes. Haskell sees them descending the stairs. He approaches and asks what they need; the bartender immediately takes the opportunity to dump the guests on Haskell and flees upstairs without explaining anything. The woman continues complaining about the lack of strong drink, now to Haskell.

Haskell manages to mix up a very nice cocktail for the woman (and Bendren). She's very thankful, hugs him, calls him friend; "lady, I just work here" - she counters that it's art!

Artur is in this warehouse, doing warehouse activities, as one does. Spots the thieves heading downstairs already. He follows just a little, staying further back and subtly casting *guidance* to be stealthier. He is one with the warehouse. They descend down the stairs, down to the basement level with the secret storages. They head to the kennels and pour something into the feeding tubes, looks like ordinary food but probably isn't. Then they head back up.

Yala is working upstairs in the auction item prep area. Two workers bring up a gigantic taxidermied bear (~5m tall), and are struggling. Yala quickly calls for more people to assist them.
Manager makes a notation on his clipboard and nods approvingly.

Back to Bendren. A whole hour and a half has passed; some people in this bar are starting a card game, light gambling, but one of the players is wearing a hat with a big veil, making it hard to see who they are - very mysterious!

He joins. It's a well-known game, but the stakes are pretty high: people are betting "I will buy this item for the winner". He keeps to a small bet. His attempt to cheat (glancing at the cards while shuffling) draws some attention from the veiled player, but he thinks he got away unnoticed and has a great hand.  It turns out everyone else has garbage hands, so he wins handily and rakes in lots of points. He gets an approving nod from the mystery player, who promises to pay the stake after the auction.

The time of recursive thieving approaches.

As Haskell is working in the kitchens, he's sent into the warehouse to get a worker to help carry stuff, throwing out trash and bringing in more ingredients from the warehouse. He sees Artur there and asks him for the help.
People smoke in the warehouse all the time, there is like no fire safety. A running joke is that it's going to catch fire any time, you should have good shoes so that you can run away when it does. Since this building is old (thus, dry) and dates back a while (Pendleham was colder then, the walls contain fatty insulation that burns extremely well) this is quite the risk.
They go outside to throw out the kitchen trash. Haskell notices something: in the garbage crate, there is a dead guy. He has no idea who it is, but he looks kind of like one of the thieves that Artur mentioned. Artur doesn't recognize him since his face is totally beaten up. He's dressed in the warehouse uniform. Struck by inspiration, Haskell tries to improvise an alteration to his Infiltrator's Elixir that turns him into the guy, but in this situation and with no tools, he gets nowhere. They decide to keep their mouths shut and not say anything, lest the heist get disrupted.

They go up and inform Yala (Artur) and Bendren (Haskell). Artur after a while notices that he hasn't seen any of the thieves in a while; it's now ~10. He knows they were planning some kind of distraction, a power outage or the like, and our guess was that they would steal the book around midday. He checks in with the ring of sigils: the book is still in the vault. It seems the thieves have been thwarted?

~10:00: Yala goes on break, makes herself *invisible*, and runs around casting *message* at her fellow party members so we can put together a new plan.

~10:15: Yala changes spell preps.

~10:30: execute plan. Yala is invisible, goes down to the basement.
Pick attempt 1: 17, fail. Get zapped, reflex 19, dodge well.
Pick attempt 2: 27, success. Progress!
Pick attempt 3: 9 (nat 1), fail! reflex 19, dodge well once more, though.
Extract broken pick: 19, ok
Pick attempt 4: 16, fail. reflex 13, take 9 electricity.
Pick attempt 5: 27, success. Hearing voices from upstairs coming to investigate!

Slip inside, duck behind the door, hide. stealth 30 (nat 20), super hidden. Some guys come down, look around, then shrug and go back upstairs.

There is another door sparking with electricity.
Pick attempt 1: 15, fail. Reflex 12, fail.
Drink elixirs from Haskell, still too low on health to risk another zap.

Yala goes back up, reports her failures. Artur proposes he give it a go. Yala casts *invisible item* on the sack, passes it and the lockpicks to Artur, and casts *invisibility* on him. He goes downstairs to see if he has better luck.
Pick attempt 1: 25, success (guidance wasted)
Pick attempt 2: 21, also success.

Now he has a complicated safe lock to pick, it is 10:40. 5 minutes per attempt.
Pick attempt 1: 18, fail. Now 10:45.
Pick attempt 2: 14, fail. Now 10:50.
Pick attempt 3: 11, fail. Now 10:55.
Pick attempt 4: 14, fail. Now 11:00
Pick attempt 5: 26, success. Now 11:05.
Pick attempt 6: 24, success. Now 11:10.
Pick attempt 7: 15, fail. Now 11:15. Yala heads down to check on him (stealth 20, ok)
Pick attempt 8: 28 (nat 20), success. 11:20
Safe clicks open. The book is there. He picks it up with the sack, carefully not touching it directly.

As Yala heads down, she spots one of the thieves: they seem to be talking to someone in the storage/deliveries area, someone making a delivery to the warehouse.

We head back up, trying our best to not be spotted. Artur slips away just fine, but Yala gets spotted by one of the thieves and their conversation partner. They make eye contact.
Artur hands the invisible-sack'd book to Haskell, who throws it in the dumpster as planned.

Artur and Yala return to work, both upstairs this time. Bendren is limiting his alcohol intake since he's here on a job.

10:30: the thief character approaches Yala upstairs, asks for help with a delivery. Yala shoots off a *message* to Artur and goes with him. The thief says actually this is down in the basement. She follows him down
"Alright so where's the fucking book"
two more people here:
delivery person that the thief was chattign with
muscular woman holding a statue, from one of the cheaper auctions. holding it like a club. (it's the same woman that was yelling about the drinks)

Yala is pretty sure she can run faster than these people.
