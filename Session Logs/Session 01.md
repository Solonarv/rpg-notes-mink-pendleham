We begin at Madam Arlette's Auberge, which is near the docks.

The harbor contains large biomagical plants which drill into the seafloor and extract various resources. They also glow as a side effect, and thus serve as lighthouses.

nice bright summer day, we've received missives asking us to come here.

Yala got the missive at breakfast, since she lives here. The others are offered food as well. It's eggplant today. The hotel has a large eggplant in the courtyard.

We all settle down, and soon enough we're joined by Mme Arlette. She's of indeterminate age, beautiful though. She tells us of a little problem: one of her rich clients has a son who studies at the athenaeum of blood & sinew. son's been out of contact for a couple of days, and was supposed to meet them right around now. so, a bit worried, but don't want to ask city guard because they might just kidnap the boy and demand ransom. So: pls go there, check if he's alright, and if not, at least recover his head so he can get a new body.

Boy's name: Misgan Gae
studying in faculty of arts
Place of living: apartment near faculty, +address
this address is a dormitory, low-cost student living in large buildings.
does he frequent any known establishments? Mme Arlett doesn't know, could ask his classmates.
Reward: insert reasonable number here

We finish up breakfast and do our daily preps before going.
Haskell tosses together some alchemy using his familiar, Flamelli.
Artur chats to his (froggy?) familiar in a pouch.

We go to the local train station, which skitters off towards the university along its rails. Ticket prices TBD. Soon enough we arrive on campus. It's expansive and has clearly seen better days. Most buildings in disrepair, partially rotting in places where their circulatory system has broken down; in some places, additional constructions as buildings are repurposed.

As we enter the territory we soon find a helpful map.
Faculty of: arts, fleshsmithing, engineering, arcane studies, etc.
We head to the faculty of arts, first.
Wide open U-shaped building, large fountain of (synth) blood in the middle of the courtyard. shifting arches of flowing blood, small fishes swimming in it. Students congregate here and there, discussing this or that. Some painting the fountain. Vibes: excitement, if anything. People are talking about the fountain itself: apparently it was broken for decades, and was recently rebuilt.

We go inside, and find ourselves in a queue of people talking to the receptionist - a young woman processing documents. Wait takes us 20 minutes or so. She asks if we're new students here; she hasn't seen us before.
Haskell: I used to be a student here, looking for an acquaintance: Misgan Gae.
She pulls out some reference documents, finds Misgan. He hasn't been going to classes for a couple weeks, as he was working on the fountain project. Completed a few days ago. He was working with a student from the engineering department, but these docs don't say who.

Off we go to the engineering department. This faculty is inside of a small basement, kinda dark, very annoyed-looking guy sitting at the counter.
Counterguy: what do you want?
Haskell: we're looking for the guy who was working on the art faculty's blood fountain.
Counterguy: annoyed about the fountain. looks through docs, finds: one Adrian Fonbram, studying engineering and fleshsmithing (double major), also has a small business in the city: "deliveries", called Squirrel and Quarrel. hasn't been seen since he started working on the fountain. doesn't have his home address but does have his business address. Asks us to tell Adrian to come back and do some real engineering instead of this art nonsense.

We decide to check out Misgan's apartment first, since it's closer. The apartment block is actually quite nice; fenced in by a special purpose-made thorny plant, doors open though. Guard looks at us to make sure we don't make trouble, but doesn't stop us. Haskell knocks on the door. Most of us notice a sudden quiet; there was a shuffling noise, before.
Haskell knocks on the door again, hard: put on your pants! we need to talk to you.
Bendren: we're here to speak to a Misgan Gae.
The door is normal, meaning it's made of bone, with a bone lock inside.
Bendren tries the door. It's locked, unsurprisingly.
Alex tries to force the door open with a crowbar, and does so easily, though he breaks the door in the process.
As we step inside, we see a room. Pretty typical: bone table in the middle, bioluminescent flesh lamp from the ceiling, cupboards, etc.
Haskell opens a door: to the kitchen/workshop, there are crafting materials spread all over, some books lying around. As he enters, he hears a rustling, like something trying to hide under the table/desk. He squats down for a better look: 
Yala follows Haskell in, while Bendren checks out the upstairs. She quickly notices two creatures hiding: some spidery creations.
many-legged creatures, with a tiny backpack

Combat!
brain bug 1: jumps out, tries to bite Haskell, 27 crit for 4 p: gets him in the leg, probably venomous. Bite again, 11 miss.
Artur: step in. electric arc for 5 lightning, targeting both brain bugs. fail, succeed. Griffin flies in.
Haskell: raise shield. unarmed @ brain bug 1, 24 hit for 4 b. again, 23 crit for 14 b: it explodes into giblets.
Yala: RK the bugs: don't seem to unusual for here, just some random fleshsmithed thing. slashing gust @ brain bug 2, 15 misses.
Bendren: rush downstairs to join combat, see it's all congested, hang out in the living room instead.
brain bug 2: also jumps at Haskell. bite - 17 hit. again - 23 hit, for 4 p; fort save: 14 fail, poisoned, stupefied 1.
Round 2.
Artur: cast evil eye @ brain bug 2: 14 fails will save, sickened 1. needle dart @ brain bug 2, 13 miss. Griffin keeps aloft.
Haskell: raise shield. attempt squish brain bug 2, 12 miss. again, 13 miss.
Yala: step forward. slashing gust, 26 crit for 8 s + 1d4 bleed.
Bendren: draw nightstick, step toward kitchen.
More brain bugs followed Bendren downstairs!
Brain bug 2: bite Haskell, 9 miss. Again, 20 miss. Again, 8 miss.
Brain bugs 3&4: bite Bendren: 25 hit, 8 miss, 10 miss. 5 miss. 6 piercing damage, succeed fort save.
Round 3.
Artur: sustain evil eye. electric arc for 4 lightning @ brain bug 2 fail, brain bug 3 succeed. Griffin stays aloft.
Haskell: Command Flamelli: grab a bestial mutagen; feed it to Haskell. His fucked-up arm grows. Squish! 22 hit for 8 b, dead. Stride into living room.
Yala: stride into living room, near Bendren. Cast protective wards. Cast shield.
Bendren: bonk brain bug 3, 14 hit. again, 13 miss. Hop onto the table for better positioning.
Another two brain bugs arrive.
Attacks against Yala and Bendren. Ow ow ow.
Artur: evil eye a brain bug, it succeeds.
Haskell: move to flank a brain bug w/yala. stomp, 10 miss. Again, 6 miss.
Yala: sustain protective ward, slashing gust two bugs: 8 miss, 18 hit.
Bendren: step. drop nightstick, draw warhammer. bonk a brain bug for 8 b.
Bug turns. Haskell gets flanked, ow ow. 21, 18, 4, 11: two hits. 5 p, 5 p. he is very poisoned.
Bendren also gets flanked, ow ow. 12, 17, 17, 11: two hits. 4 p, 3 p.
Round 4.
It is at this point that we notice Alex Rasra hasn't been added to the initiative tracker.
Artur: cast evil eye @ a brain bug, it succeeds. electric arc @ two brain bugs. both crit succeed.
Haskell: step. stomp a brain bug, 18 hit for 7 b. command Flamelli: take out juggernaut mutagen, feed it to Haskell.
Yala: sustain protective ward. 2⋄ force barrage, split: 4, 3. Nearly kills a brain bug.
Bendren: try to finish off the nearly-dead brain bug, miss both times.
Bug turns: biting Yala. 12, 22, 8, 23. Ow ow. Two hits. Stupefied again.
nearly-dead bug flees out the door. Bendren gets bitten: 17 hit for 5 p. 
Round 5.
Alex: {delay/skip}
Artur: evil eye a brain bug, it fails. electric arc for 7 lightning @ two brain bugs. fail, succeed.
Haskell: try to finish off bug in front of him: 19 hit for 6 b, squish. raise shield. RK a bug: this is the most basic kind of lab helper/worker that fleshsmiths use for manual labor. these ones' backpacks have an image of a squirrel on them.
Yala: sustain protective ward. stride 2x into the kitchen, shout: door! chokepoint!
Bendren: warhammer squish a bug, 19 hit for 9 b: it's dead. 2⋄ heal on Haskell for 10.
One bug remains. It goes after Alex, who's closest.
Round 6.
Alex: {delay/skip}
Artur: evil eye the brain bug, it fails. electric arc again for 7 light. succeeds.
Haskell: stride. revivifying mutagen, consume jugg mutagen to heal for 6. smack brain bug, 16 hit for 7 b.
Yala: stride into living room, stride back into kitchen, sustain protective ward.
Bendren: stride up to bug. warhammer, 22 hit for 9 b, squish dead!
**Combat over.**
XP: 120 (since there were only 4 players)
#TotalXP 120

taking a break, 15min.

refocus, treat wounds, poking around, etc - total 40 minutes
Artur remembers stuff about the brain bugs. They're basically lab homunculi, usually really dumb. just a brain with some legs 
these ones are unusual: they have a carapace and venom, and backpacks. they also seem a bit smarter, hiding and coordinating in the fight.

first floor: livingroom,kitchen,storage
2nd floor: small office, bedroom. looks rather more turned-over, someone clearly went through here.

Yala casts detect magic and investigates: university docs; textbooks, notes; some financial records for Squirrel & Quarrel, apparently Misgan was a cofounder of it. Also a diary where he complains about disagreements with the other co-founder: Misgan wanted to expand, Adrian didn't; they disagreed on the aesthetics as well. There are even docs in the backpacks of the thingies.

She checks out the financial records. Disagreements on design of the 'squirrels', the brain bugs. Misgan: they should look good. Adrian: they should be stronger, carapace claws etc. Address of the office, map of a lab where they did the fleshsmithing.

Also find a key, which is slightly magical. Symbol of blood drops on the handle, could stand for like 50 different things. This is the sort of key fleshsmiths might use for their labs. Magic probably matches with the lock's own magic. Runes around the blood-drops symbol are decorative/fluff/maker's mark.

Diary dates: latest is a couple days ago, not super unusual. Got together a long while ago. Fountain project, they worked together closely. While working on the fountain, they had the idea for the Squirrel & Quarrel delivery service: sneaky tough brainbeasts so their deliveries don't get stolen. Adrian had some kind of idea for how to do this, how to make them smart enough to manage this.

Bendren, investigating the brain beasts, notices something very unusual. Normally their brains are tiny (which is why they're dumb), but these ones have much bigger brains; human brains. Those tend to be pretty expensive and you wouldn't waste them on a brain beast.

At Yala's suggestion, we stash the brain beasts inside the cold box in the kitchen, so they'll be preserved better.

Artur casts detect metal, but finds nothing surprising - except that the metal is painted bone, not metal.

Haskell and Yala fix the door using materials and tools scavenged from the apartment. Some other students are looking, but quickly leave once they see people are here.

Bendren takes a brain beast with him for potential later study. Haskell does too. Yala furiously scribbles into her notes.

Bendren drops a 2⋄ heal on Yala, 18 healing her back to full. We then head to the Squirrel & Quarrel. Nobody seems to question our slightly suspicious actions.

It takes us a bit to actually find the S&Q office - it's not on the ground floor, but in the basement, and the door just has an unobtrusive sign and a post box.
paper: closed temporarily. if you need me, find me at university. signed, Adrian Fonbram.
look inside, two rooms: entryway, office. some desks, some papers lying around. very minimal. nobody inside. We try the key: it's too big.

We have a moment of thought about the law, as we consider breaking into this office. By the books, it's clearly illegal - we have no writ, warrant, or anything of the sort, nor permission from the owner/renter/??. However in practice the only people who would give a shit are Adrian Fonbarm, or someone he paid for protection. There are no signs of such protection and there usually would be, prominent ones. So Haskell kicks in the glass on a window, and pushes his familiar inside.

The mudroom has a shoe rack, a coatrack, a doormat saying "Fleshsmithing rules!". His familiar opens the door from inside, and we enter. The other room has a single desk and piles of papers, which we search.

There is financial stuff, business plans, etc. Eventually Flamelli notices a secret compartment, which we open. Inside are secret financial documents, how they're doing the fleshsmithing stuff, the setup of their lab, how they're dealing with the uni to supply it with: water, electricity, biochemical precursors, etc. This is mixed in with their work on the fountain.

Haskell remembers that the uni uses keys like the one we found for its locks, including but not only on the labs. The labs are kinda scattered all over the place, some even off campus. Some are technically available but nobody goes there because of a dangerous escape or a leak or whatever. Some of them, the uni just kinda forgot where they are, whether by accident or by malice. In principle though, the uni has lists of labs and who's using them. They're identified by symbols, and the symbol on the key looks like one of the lab symbols.

Haskell thinks a receptionist would probably be bribable for the "which lab does this symbol belong to" info. A bribe of a couple gp should do.

We walk into the fleshsmithing facility. The receptionist smiles, stands up, spreads her arms to welcome Haskell back: "You've come to pay your dues, right?"
H: yeah of course, I just had to... quickly go out of town for a while, it was an emergency.
Receptionist: always happy to take your money! :)
H: yeah uh, so this is probably gonna cost somebody - we found a lab key. not mine, they'll probably want it back.
She doesn't care much about the key, but she will try to blackmail whoever lost the key with her silence over them losing the key.
H: I spoke to Prof. Mink, he said I should keep it safe on my person - if you could just check the symbol? he stressed that this key should not be lost. I think maybe they were doing some work for him?
She's not really buying it but just on the off chance she's going along.
Haskell bribes her with 1 gp to just forget about his dues for a while and check for the lab symbol. It takes her quite a while of searching through the books to find it.
It's not a lab, it's a pump room - responsible for that fountain at the art faculty. She tells us the location of the room also.

We head there: a little building a ways away from the fountain, with a tunnel leading toward the fountain, beaded with blood. At the end is a massive door, with a smaller door - like a cat door - to the side, and the three-blood-drop symbol on it.
