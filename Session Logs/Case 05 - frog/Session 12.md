Defibrillator box is: big and black, has a symbol of a heart being zapped with a lightning bolt.

Yala casts invisible item on the defibrillator, because we don't have a tarp to cover it up.

We get through the city with no issues, no comical accidents of any sort. STELTH!

We reach Valentina von Zapp's boats, which is actually two boats.

One is wooden, has some equipment, and a door set up.

The other boat is small and speedy, it's where von Zapp is. She instructs us to get on the wooden boat.

On the boat is a harpoon trailing a giant cable, aimed directly at the door. There's a spot for the defibrillator.

Valentina's small boat passes, she waves us over and tells us she's set up everything for us. We're to just call her over when we're done, it should be very easy. Yala finds this to be a lie: while Valentina *did* make it easier, and Yala wouldn't have any problems, it's hardly easy for a layperson.

We get in position... to wait, because the defibrillator is still invisible for another half-hour. Yala uses this time to get her wounds treated by Bendren and rest up, and swaps a water breathing out for entangling flora.

door is big enough for frog to squeeze through

how to shoot the thing:
- 1⋄ to figure out the mechanism (takes a check, not needed for Artur and Yala)
- 1⋄ to shoot the thing

pre-fight setup:
- positions
- Yala pre-casts protective wards and grows it for a few rounds first.
- Haskell attaches some of the bait meat to the hook
- Haskell distributes and we drink some mutagens

FOR EVERY ROUND SHOCKED, CUMULATIVE:  
- 10d6 damage (-2d6 damage/rnd)  
- -3 AC  
- -3 all saves  
- -3 all resistances (goes negative)  
- -3 attack bonus

Initiative! Round 1:
- Yala: sustain wards. 2⋄ ready: shoot harpoon thingy at frog when right moment.
- Bendren: open door. scooch aside. raise shield. !!{ Yala fires the cannon! }
- Frog: leaps up into the air, snatches up the now-airborne bait. croaks/squeals. Awful sound. Sparks everywhere. 10d6=40 lightning damage to frog.
- Artur: evil eye @ frog, frog succeeds. 2⋄ fear @ frog via item, frog succeeds and is frightened 1.
- Haskell: walk in. raise shield. walk away again. (??)

Round 2:
- Yala: sustain wards. 2⋄ cast entangling flora into the extradimensional lab, catching the frog.
- Bendren: walk around to get LoS on the frog. 2⋄ bone shaker @ frog, frog fails, takes 12 b.
- Frog: squeeze out the door. hop over there. CHOMP mechanism: 26 crits (but not) for 19 p. The mechanism is still holding up. Another 8d6=24 lightning to the frog, more horrible noises.
- Artur: 2⋄ laughing fit @ frog, frog fails and is slowed 1! stride to (relative) safety.
- Haskell: make a vial of acid, throw it at frog: 14 miss, deal 1 acid splash+6 from weakness. Raise shield.

Round 3:
- Yala: sustain wards. 2⋄ force barrage for 7 force + 6 from weakness.
- Bendren: draw pistol. shoot: ~~20 miss~~7 still a miss{ accidental shot }.
- Frog: {yala looks tasty} TONGUE attack @ yala, 29 hits for 12 b and pulls. CHOMP yala: 23 hit for 14 p (ouch). zapped for 6d6=11 total. Yala manages somehow to catch not a single spark of that zap.
- Artur: sustain laughing fit. 2⋄ soothe @ yala for 5 hp.
- Haskell: {start of turn: mystery will save, fails, now encumbered} move into melee. raise shield. claw @ frog, 12 miss.

Round 4:
- Yala, swallowed: {start of turn: mystery will save} escape (barely). final surge to double-stride away. sustain wards.
- Bendren: {start of turn: mystery will save} move into range, 2⋄ heal @ yala for 20 hp.
- Frog: CHOMP machine, 28 hit for 22 p, machine down. CHOMP haskell, 19 miss.
- Artur: open Griffin's carrier. {independent griffin: fly}. 0⋄ cackle to sustain, extend duration of effects on frog. 2⋄ electric arc, frog succeeds: 5 lightning + 6 from remaining weakness.
- Haskell: Claw frog, 14 miss. Stride away

Round 5:
- Yala: sustain wards. 2⋄ Cast another entangling flora (via drain bonded item), getting the frog.
- Bendren: shoot frog, 22 hit for 6 p effective.

Frog had some sort of spiritual "weight" aura. Feels very heavy.

Valentina von Zapp comes back. Her boat has a flagellum for propulsion, and she's holding a spyglass: clearly she was watching us from a distance. She tries to bill us for the frog breaking the machine; Artur tries to argue her down, to little success.

Haskell inspects the machine and notes that some of the damage looks worse than it is. As he points this out to Valentina, she relents and lowers her ask to 15 gp.

Yala pulls out 15 gp and hands them to Valentina. Yala notices that she's starting to trip from the frog saliva.

Valentina pulls out gloves before accepting the gold. (Yala: "yeah that's probably a good idea")

Yala then jumps overboard after asking everyone else to pull her out in a minute, to wash off the frog saliva. Fortunately, her terrible, no good, very bad drug trip's onset is slow enough that she makes it out just fine.

Valentina brings us back to shore, drops us off, thanks us for the business, and exhorts us to return to her if we need rid of any more frogs.
