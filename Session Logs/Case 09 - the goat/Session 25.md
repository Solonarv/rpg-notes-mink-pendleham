red snakes are attacking RIGHT NAOW oh no

initiative!
- leader lady gestures to us, says goat is this way, and goes off.
- gang fighting
- yala follows her to the goat. it has very big and impressive horns.
	- standing, very long legs, back on the same level as Yala's nose
	- leader lady indicates the sewer access is in the courtyard we were in just now
	- cage would not easily fit through the door, but can be disassembled
		- unfortunately this would free the goat
		- the goat says MÄÄÄÄÄÄHHH
	- walk in to where the cage is
	- MÄÄÄÄÄHH
	- attach a rope lead to the goat (it does not make this overly hard)
- artur readies himself
- haskell quaffs a quick-alch'd elixir of life, leans on artur
	- he blames the goat
ROUND 2
- fighting continues
- leader lady GTFOs without even telling yala which one the sewer door is
- Yala ties the goat's lead to the door hinges and starts disassembling the cage (1/3).
- Artur approaches Yala, marvels at the goat, and starts helping to disassemble the cage (2/3).
- Haskell arrives and goes "holy fuck that s a big goat". it replies MÄÄÄÄÄH!
	- he considers drugging the goat.
		- he creates an infiltrator's elixir to drug the goat with, if needed.
	- he finishes disassembling the cage (3/3). the goat 
ROUND 3
- the goat stares at Haskell, goes MÄÄÄÄHHH, bolts, gets caught by the rope, and starts MÄÄÄÄHing in shock.
- more fighting
- Yala instructs Haskell to get the rope, then strides up to the goat and makes it invisible.
	- the goat's opinion on this matter: MÄH MÄH MÄH MÄH MÄH!
- Artur steps up to the goat and leaves a *sigil* (invisible) on it.
- Haskell steps up to the goat and tries to flamelli on top of it (doesn't work). he tries again, this time with a ration as bribe/distraction. the goat snatches the food, but does not let flamelli on.
ROUND 4
- the goat is once more trying to tear the rope. it succeeds at unraveling Yala's knot (fortunately, just on the doorhinge side). it then dashes about madly, trailing the rope behind.
- Yala's actions:
	- HASKELL GRAB THE FCKING ROPE
	- run after the goat
	- grab the rope (just in case it helps somehow)
- Artur moves up and grabs the rope
- Haskell grabs the rope, flamelli: move up and grab the goat!
ROUND 5
- one green armadillo thug stumbles in, injured and bleeding.
- the goat starts running back the way it came
	- Yala gets bowled over and dragged along.
	- it continues toward the door LL left through, and bounces off. this is still enough to knock artur over.
	- it switches direction once more, leaving it not very far from where it started.
- Yala gets up, goes to one of the doors in the courtyard, and opens it. She's greeted by sewer stench and informs the party of this.
- Artur moves up the rope towards the goat and begins trying to calm it with an offering of water. the goat greedily accepts this and calms down a little, allowing artur to drag it toward the sewer entrance a little.
- Haskell moves toward the goat, choking up on the rope as he goes. He commands flamelli to land on the goat, which the goat graciously allows (for now).
ROUND 6
- the injured thug gets shot as he's still fleeing. another guy gets thrown into the wall on the other end of the map. The fight is closing in on us.
- the goat's inclination is 1d100=90% positive.
- Yala casts *grease* to slow down the dead thug's pursuers, waves at the others to follow, and slips inside the stinky door.
- Artur and Haskell drag/push the goat towards the door, until its horns clink against the frame. It complains: MÄÄÄH!
	- Artur attempts to teach the goat the way of the ferret to help it slip through the door.
	- Haskell closes the door
ROUND 7
- the goat remembers its demonic heritage. It does not look fondly on its brief stint as a ferret, a far inferior lifeform.
	- It spots the other door (that Yala is standing by), and understands: doors lead to places. let's go!
		- Haskell and Artur manage to hold it back, it falls down
	- It gets up and runs into a corner
	- MÄH MÄH MÄÄÄÄHHH MÄH!
- Yala opens the next door, steps in, and finds the sewer access. She pulls off the grate blocking it.
- Artur bribes the goat with life-boosting oil, unclear how well this works.
- Haskell starts dragging the goat towards the sewer entrance
	- the goat disagrees loudly, but is powerless to resist
	- unfortunately there is another door
		- he tries to solve this by simply grabbing the horns and maneuvering them through there
		- the dice have other ideas
		- ![[Pasted image 20250615230212.png]] 
		- he tries again and gets it this time
ROUND 8
- a red snake thug kicks in the door, and shoots artur in the face with a crossbow.  however artur's face is elsewhere. There are more behind him.
- Yala repositions to see out through both doors and fireballs the courtyard. It's very effective. There are screams and shouts of "there's a wizard!".
- Artur: delay
- Haskell: drag/shove the goat toward the sewer entrance, and stuff it down the hole, miraculously getting down there on the first try.
	- the goat takes a fall, but doesn't die or anything.
		- this triggers the life-boosting oil. the goat is fine.
- Artur follows us into the sewer-access room, closing the door on the way out.

we've done it! we make off through the sewers with our stolen(ish) goat.

As we leave, we hear rocks falling; someone's collapsed the buildings.
