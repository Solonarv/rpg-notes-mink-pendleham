preacher starts by talking about whats been happening
- house fire in a building
- survival of the city, how things are going
- teufelbos murder, oblique mention of yala: tomorrow this investigator will come in, talk about this in more detail, im sure many of you are excited
- crowd is indeed excited - not rabid cheering, but voicing agreement with many things

yala at least makes sure to stay until the end - burning curiosity about their ideology
- they dont really like fleshsmiths, to put it mildly
- yala is very sure: there is this god, he is dead, and there is a connection with the land: god died and became the land, or the land killed the god, very unclear. fleshsmiths are the bad guys in all this. it's their fault, somehow.

at the end there is a little ritual:
- little plates of deliciously smelling bbq'd meat that someone had been cooking
- yala manages to convince the little grandma who offers her some that she should explain the sacrament first:
	- this is human flesh
	- someone died recently
	- they happen to practice ritual cannibalism
	- ties in with their god, sharing back with the land
	- Yala does partake, takes this as the deeply touching gesture it is
	- Artur is very interested in rituals and so also partakes
	- Haskell has seen weirder things anyway, but gets uncomfortable when his shoulder-mouth Bob starts to salivate
	- the meat actually is very tasty
		- there's some vegetables on the side also
		- some other meat
		- some soup (from brains)
		- some other stuff

sermon ends there, people disperse and start chatting to each other.

one of the soldiers finds Yala, starts introducing her to his grandma, his wife, etc; he seems like he wants to invite her to some family function maybe? theyre all talking fast, its a bit unclear. Yala manages to politely refuse, though she almost fumbles it because they're all talking at the same time.

The other two go up to the pastor, whisper about something, then disappear into one of the back rooms the church has. they dont seem super suspicious but are definitely having some sort of private discussion. Haskell and Artur wisely decide not to eavesdrop or barge in.

Artur sends Griffin to snoop around, but the goose gets spotted (and caught, despite valorous flapping) by a grandma. Artur gets him back and makes excuses - "can't take him anywhere".

Yala talks to the soldier and his family some more:
- soldier was brought here by a buddy (whom he can't spot right now)
- found his wife here, got married
- now he always goes here

we join the trickle of people leaving now.

we consider what we know. we have basically enough information to bring to Mme Arlette, but we could also push further and try to fins out who specifically is involved.

the next day, Griffin reports to Artur via telepathy. They were discussing us, basically- this elf who found the cannonball, they seemed embarrassed to have forgotten the cannonball. if she could trace it back to this military base, could other people do the same? One of the guys from the carriage company also mentioned people seeming very similar to us looking to hire a carriage- the same one that was used in the assassination. They haven't agreed on what to do about us but definitely suspect us.

we ponder what would 
other fleshsmiths would probably make an example of them. that military base would probably get burned down and everyone inside would be killed. depending on how pissed-off they are they might even sink the island.

we decide to report the soldiers, but not the church; hoping, in the case of Artur and Yala, that the fleshsmiths won't find the church independently after we give them a lead; or, in Haskell's case, that they do find (and kill) the church, as their anti-fleshsmith rhetoric really ticks him off.

We do just that, not mentioning the church but yes mentioning that we traced the cannon, backfilling a little about how we found out the soldiers are related to it. Mme Arlette seems to accept the story, says "I'll see what I can do about it".

The response is pretty quick, only a couple days later a group of fleshsmiths raids this military base. They don't quite chase down every last soldier, and don't bother messing with the company's other bases. The island is, however, set on fire, with most everyone present being murdered in variously horrific ways.

Some fleshsmiths do a followup investigation, and some do sneak around the church neighborhood, but they don't quite sniff out the church and it gets off mostly scot free.

As a result of this, the vibe in Pendleham improves significantly, as close to peaceful as Pendleham gets. Seems to have released a lot of tension.

We get paid 30gp, split three ways for 10gp a pop.

Haskell takes the opportunity to set up a watch on the island so he can yoink some livers. He gets Yala to come watch as well (she intends to write many papers and articles about this), but she refuses his offer to engage in some battlefield cannibalism; she has relatives that still do it but seems vaguely offput by it. She also comes with him onto the island to observe the aftermath up close.

We go in after a good chunk of the danger has dissipated, and get:
- 3 corpses in decent condition (i.e. more than half is intact), incl. livers
	- this is actually enough to fully pay off his student debts
- some other stuff TBD

the island's name changes: the soldiers' graveyard.

two months downtime.
