We spend a couple weeks just earning income...
- Haskell works as a fleshsmith
- Yala: week 1 fail, 7 sp; week 2 crit success, 6.3 gp; net +7 gp
- Bendren works as a doctor

Haskell's adventures in the poison pool got sick, so his memories of the rest of the adventure are a bit fuzzy. When he recovers, he remembers his promise to get the university some livers; but nobody was killed during the adventure. He avoids the university, hoping to stumble across some free livers.

Yala and Bendren hear the big explosive news in the city: alley of sight, was controlled by Mr Teufelbos. Tower with eyes pyramid on top was his. He was taking a walk next to it, and someone shot him in the face with a small cannon; he's super dead, despite all his fleshsmithed augments. This leaves his lab headless. They're gearing up to war with a neighboring lab, whom they accuse of killing Teufelbos; the other lab denies this and is also gearing up for war. Lots of tension in the air, everyone is getting ready for shit to go down.
Alley is covered in eyeballs that are supposed to see everything, but none of them saw shit.

A day after this murder, Mme Arlette calls us. She brings out the expensive tea, and gets right down to business. War is on the brink of erupting, bad for everyone. She's been sending people to try and find out who killed Teufelbos.

Yala: figured this was why you called us. Any leads other than public knowledge?
A: just so many leads (she has a box brought out, it's full of letters and such). About 50 different groups (covertly) taking credit, for the clout. No idea which one it really was. We do know when and where it happened, though, could be a start.
Y: any idea how long we have?
A: until war breaks out. days at most.
Y: best get on with it I guess.
A: btw I have most of my people on this. sort of a hail mary. anything you can find would be good.
Y: you are paying us, right? - yes, as per usual.

Haskell mentions needing livers and Yala gets the story out of him.

We set off to the Alley of Sight via metro. We hop out and find ourselves in a very tense atmosphere. Few people on the streets; more are glancing out warily from windows, doorways are barricaded, etc. Alley itself used to be a richer part of town, taller buildings; many have biochemical augmentations, some have eyes or legs or whatever else. It's all not super well maintained, but better than the rest of the city. The lab itself is this giant sky-scraping tower, with many giant eyeballs at the top staring out over the city. Also used to be a lighthouse back in the day, for the ships coming in, but these eyes haven't lit the bay for a long time now.

Murder happened right in front of the tower's doors, has been cleaned up, but there is a giant scorchmark on the ground where the cannon fired and a dent in the wall where the cannonball stuck, with the ball still embedded in it.

As we head there, we notice the lab itself watching us, but nobody tells us to stop since we're just a small group.

Yala investigates the cannonball, pulling it out of the wall with a usage of *fold metal*.

About half of Teufelbos' skull is stuck into the wall behind where the ball was, though it's a bit hard to tell since the ball is also made of bone.

Ball is metal (duh). Covered in soot and caked blood. On the side, the words "a pound of flesh" are engraved. The ball weighs about 10 lb.

Ideas on the phrase:
- Haskell, Bendren: no idea
- Yala distantly remembers: there's a second lab, not quite across the street but in the same region. Fairly big fleshsmithing lab, specializes in big equipment (level a building, dig a big hole, etc). They have a saying: a good pound of flesh is worth its weight in gold.

We ponder: the ensuing chaos was predictable. Who benefits?

We try to figure out how well-regarded Teufelbos was. He was not well-liked, even more so than the typical fleshsmith. In Pendleham, it's not unusual to grab subjects off the street and cut them up; but most fleshsmiths are covert/circumspect about it. Not this guy though; he'd just roll up with his car and grab people.

Reason why fingers are pointing at the construction company: they're in similar business as Teufelbos, big creatures vs. growing things. There are creatures you can plant in a spot of land, they'll burrow in and do similar things, but with a different approach. They're competitors.

We speculate on the kind of statement made by killing a fleshmith *in public, with a cannon* specifically. Yala thinks it's not the kind of statement a fleshsmith would make.

Bendren inspects the nearby eyes. He notices that most of them look a bit lifeless and grayish.

Yala walks around a bit and finds that the presumably-blind eyes are indeed concentrated around the big tower.

She picks a random office center / residential building and tries to ask the private security about the blind eyeballs. They don't seem very happy about this line of inquiry, but she bribes him with 2 gp, which seems sufficient: this has been going on for about 2 weeks. started out slow, been spreading. Eyes shutting off one by one, they called a fleshsmith who said the eye is sick somehow, but not sure how. Nobody seems to have a cure. She gets the business info of the fleshsmith they called in, a local building doctor, and bribes the guard with another 2 gp for their discretion. The conversation also confirms that (at least some of the) eyes are supposed to be working and aren't.

This street is normally pretty well-traveled; lots of people live and work here. The shot happened early in the morning, before dawn, so the streets probably wouldn't have been *too* busy at that time.

Bendren pokes around nearby sewer grates, bushes, etc to see if something was left behind near the scorchmark, though he doesn't expect to find much since the site was cleaned and it's been over a day. There was so much fire from the cannon that the ground was scorched; it was pretty point-blank (just a few meters away).

Bendren scrapes some brain matter, bone, etc out of the hole.

Yala ponders the associations cannons have in Pendleham. They're an old weapon, used to be more popular before fleshsmithing took off, so they're seen as somewhat oldfashioned; but fleshsmiths do use them, replacing an arm with a cannon and such. Some would be associated with the port, since ships often carried cannons, but they got replaced by fleshsmithed creations, e.g. a dolphin to poke holes in the enemy ship. More info could be found by getting the cannonball analyzed.

Bendren and Yala head to the university to get the cannonball analyzed.

Meanwhile, Haskell goes back to Mme Arlette to report in what we found so far and see if her network can pull on the new leads we found:
- report eye sickness: 
- going through the papers: at first it makes no sense, then he decides to put them in chronological order and finds several early mentions of a carriage pulling up to the lab shortly before the murder and leaving shortly afterward.

Bendren and Yala at the uni: while it's focused on fleshsmithing, they do have a small faculty for conventional weapons. It takes some doing to actually figure out where it is: the basement of a small building in the history faculty, which has a small staircase, down, up through a specific other staircase.

People are very surprised to see us. Faculty and students are all drinking tea and chatting about weapons and engineering. They ask us what we want.

Yala explains, and also asks why they're hidden here (all the better places were taken, they're bitter about it). She continues by showing them the cannonball, explaining that it killed Mr Teufelbos and we're looking into that death.

They're all super excited about the opportunity to analyze this cannonball and give us a whole lot of information. None of it is directly actionable, but one student recognizes the description and says they were just reading a small-publisher book last night that had the same saying. They bring in the book, which is a pamphlet cheaply printed in an underground press, only a few weeks ago. An article entitled "a pound of flesh" explains how bad fleshsmiths are for Pendleham, and blames them for the fall of the empire.
