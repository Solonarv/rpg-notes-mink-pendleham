We regather our wits.

Bendren and Yala think about anti-fleshsmith organizations in Pendleham. There aren't any big current ones, but there are some old ones and some newer but very small ones.

old naval base on an island in the river: mostly fallen out of use. used to have organization there that belonged to imperial army, but now empire gone - organization still there. they dont have a lot funding but offer protection for merchants in the river and the drill platforms in the bay. imperial loyalists, not associated with any fleshsmiths/patrons which is unusual for their size.

another organization: a not-exactly-church/cult, informal gathering of people with certain religious views. not very well known. dress strangely for pendleham: robes, red sashes around waist. live on east side of the river, near the eastern border of the city. Church of the Dead God.

we meet up at our base in the docks to update each other. Haskell gets there first, by virtue of a) being closer and b) not getting stunlocked by an academic infodump.

actual stone bridges, kinda fancy, very old construction. island is fortified. as we approach, we're hailed by some people dressed as imperial soldiers.

Yala introduces herself, says she's a journalist and came here to research this city. She'd like to talk to some people for research, specifically the role Pendleham's fleshsmiths may have played in the downfall of the empire. This seems to go over well, and we're invited in through the small door in the big gate.

The gate guards direct us to their tavern, where we might find someone who's not on duty. One of the guards also writes us a visitor's pass, and explains not to go into restricted areas.

Tavern is pretty central, clearly used to be a mess hall (117th naval brigade). From inside we can hear cheery sounds of soldiers drinking and playing. We get some strange looks from the soldiers, since they're all wearing uniform-style clothing (although much patched, mended, faded, etc - still clinging to imperial appearance) and we aren't.

The inside is a long room with tables all throughout, about 1/4 converted to a bar and the rest still a mess hall, with a military kitchen and people eating. The bar has kegs of beer, people drinking and playing cards.

Yala's thoughts on the empire: genocide bad, actually. not a fan.
on the soldiers (vibe check): desperately clinging to an idealized past, more pitiable than despicable.

military rank knowledge: ehhh.

barman has two small crosses on epaulets, indicating a fairly high rank. other soldiers seem to treat him with respect.

Yala approaches the bar, asks: aren't you a bit high-ranked to be slinging mugs? joke doesn't seem to land, he goes "how can I help you, civilian?" but some of the other soldiers seem at least amused. She awkwardly asks for a mug of ale (Bendren chimes in with "make that two"), which earns her a glare and a slam of said mug onto the counter. He turns away after collecting payment.

She sidles up to the most amused-looking soldier and asks if she said something wrong. The answer: Major Brunkowski here, he was our logistics officer, responsible for gear and storage. But a couple weeks back there was an unfortunate incident and he's on punishment duty since then.

She continues chatting up the soldiers, building up a sort of rapport. Major Brunkowski doesn't mind the punishment duty as such, but hates being reminded of it.

bunch of stuff got stolen from their storage, had some cannons there. there was a break-in, they just vanished, about 1Â½ weeks ago. this doesnt happen often, because its a military base full of soldiers and its just not worth the risk. soldiers dont really blame the guy for missing this, since nobody could have expected it.

the soldiers do joke about the murder and don't seem too fond of fleshsmiths. probably not a great approach to say "oh btw we're investigating this murder".

After quaffing one of Haskell's silvertongue mutagens, Yala instead explains that we went to look at the site where Teufelbos was killed, because that's a wild thing that happened - and go figure, the cannonball was still there, so we just kinda... took it, and found some weapon nerds at the athenaeum.

She pulls out the cannonball to show it off, to the soldiers' great excitement. Major Brunkowski is sneaking looks. They all agree it's one of theirs, 100%. They also nerd out about the cannon again.

She draws their attention to the engraving, "a pound of flesh". Do they know what it means? Most seem indifferent, but some of the soldiers in the back shoot us some knowing looks.

Yala *messages* Bendren (subtly! amazing!) to talk to those guys, and continues to wildly speculate about what the phrase might mean, to the great enjoyment of the soldiers.

Bendren sidles up to one of the people who gave Yala knowing looks and goes on about "that article", noting there was probably quite a buzz around here/the docks. The message getting out there has gotta be exciting, right?

They're checking him out, giving him the "is he a fed?" once-over. He introduces himself, by name and business, and notes he's had pro-imperial customers (implying he feels graced by this). They appreciate his apparent patriotism.

heropoint retcon: Yala also *messaged* Haskell to pass another silvertongue mutagen to Bendren, which he downs before approaching the a-pound-of-flesh-knowers. while talking about this, we also establish Haskell's reception: the soldiers seem to have settled on viewing him as a victim of fleshsmithing experiments gone wrong.

Bendren manages to ingratiate himself with them, which wasn't too hard given the setup. He asks about the momentum in the community, have they considered putting out literature of their own? They take interest: oh, you wanna *participate*?

He says he just wants to be respectful, know his customers, (rolls a 7 which rerolls into a 3), they don't get wtf he's going on about. They make it very clear: buddy, you in, or you out? He says he's in. They explain: alright, if you're in, here's what you gotta do. Major Brunkowski has some keys to one of the warehouses. It'd be great if you could borrow one of them for us, and if you did, we could tell you more stuff.

They describe they key to him and go "oh, just put it back later, he won't notice, don't worry about it :)"

He manages to catch Yala's attention, and she initiates a brief *message* exchange where he tells her he needs to steal a warehouse key; Yala goes wtf Bendren no, explain, later; he replies explain later, key now; Yala ends with a firm no. (OOC: not on this little information)

Bendren asks the dissidents when they need this key. They have no specific timetable, but they're clearly not telling him more until he brings them the key. He says "if you'll excuse me a moment..." and goes over to Haskell. He then leads them over to the bar, tells Haskell to follow his lead, and flags down Major Brunkowski as if to order something. He spins a yarn about his unfortunate mutated friend here (Haskell) and asks for a quiet space / a receptacle, "some drainage has to occur". The bartender directs them towards the latrines, absolutely disgusted. Bendren's attempt to get Major Brunkowski to personally show the way fails, but he flags down another soldier for the task instead.

Once alone at the latrine, Bendren explains to Haskell that he needs the Major's key stolen, and Haskell has the nimbler fingers.

Session ends at this dramatic point
