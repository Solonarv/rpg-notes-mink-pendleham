Bendren fell ill to Sudden Fainting Disease, very unfortunate. This cuts short our visit to the mercenaries.

We decide to check out the Church of the Dead God instead.

strategy: let them speechify at us ("here's why our ideology is correct!"), *then* link this to the 

CotDG are not underground/secret, but not super well-known. local church, works mostly in their neighborhood. We consider attending one of their public events/services, too.

We go to the neighborhood where the Church is and just look around first. It's a fairly poor neighborhood, not the worst but certainly not in a good place. run-down houses that look abandoned, some occupied by squatters. many streets, but some are reasonably well-maintained. some businesses are open - stores, local service businesses, etc, plus two big ones: the Church itself, tall squareish building. beautifully painted sign of giant humanoid pulled down and cut into by tiny people, his eyes rolled back, above the doors of the church. other business: taxi company of sorts, not uncommon in pendleham (though horses are exotic). looking in from the street, we can see a parking space with all sorts of different vehicles. seems to be doing much better than the rest of the neighborhood, even the workers are healthier.

Description of murder cart compared to carts in lot: the murder cart wouldn't be out of place here, but none of the carts that are actually here seem to match.

Yala suggests we approach the carriage company first, acting as if we want to rent a carriage to move something heavy (a big heavy still (for distilling alcohol), which the underfunded agricultural sciences department at the Athenaeum is selling off) so that we get to look at their carts. If we see one that matches the description of the cart probably used in the murder, we can look at that one more closely.

Artur takes point, bolstered by a silvertongue mutagen from Haskell's vials. We go up to the gate (which is large and chained up), and ring a doorbell. A guard exits a small office building near the fence, comes to the gate, and glances at our relatively expensive-looking clothes. His eyes light up at the prospect of customers for this Jack, Jack & Jack taxicab company. He opens up the smaller gate in the big gate, ushers us into his office to talk.

Artur explains we're evaluating a few different taxicab companies to find a vehicle sturdy enough to handle the large heavy still. We'd need this in 4-5 days. The guard takes us to their cart park to look at the vehicles, and notes some are still being repaired so aren't available right now.

He continues chatting about the company: they're from this neighborhood, trying to help people out, lots of them work here. Lots of people from the community. He gives us a short overview of the company's history, which he started with his two brothers. All three of their names are Jack - their father had a very poor imagination, their mother is mad at this butwhat can you do. They call themselves Big/Middle/Little Jack - he's Middle Jack.

Middle Jack shows us a bunch of carts, and indicates the second warehouse where the carts currently under repair are stored. One of them looks very similar to the cart from the incident, though it has an open roof. Its size, chassis, and ability to carry heavy things all match though.

Artur spins a yarn about how it would be helpful to see where their carts tend to break down etc so we'd 

He leads us in there, we can see some workers working on carts. He explains most of the damage is from running into something, not really incidents from carts being overloaded as they're built pretty sturdy.

Artur manages to spot a cart that matches the descriptions we have amazingly well, in an adjacent room not easily seen.
one door cracked open with burn marks all around, as if from some kind of explosion

Jack asks "so which carriage do you want?"
Artur points out the carriage under repair (Haskell and Yala also get to see it now), and asks if they have a similar one that isn't broken. Jack says that's an older model, they do have a roofless variant that they could put a roof on. They could do this by tomorrow if we pay for the Super Express Elite Customer package, otherwise it'd take like 4 days (Jack tries really hard to sell Yala on that package).

Yala asks after pricing. Jack gives some numbers, which are a bit low relative to what she'd expect for this kind of service. 

Artur says we'll get back to him by end of day or early tomorrow morning, which has Jack despondent that we're not hiring right away.

Haskell thinks about the burn marks on the cart. They have a circular pattern, as if something exploded close to the door directed outwards and the backwash of flame scorched the outside of the carriage.

We go look at the church more closely. There is a noticeboard outlining when services take place, and in fact there is one scheduled for this evening at dusk.

Walking around the neighborhood, we didn't see anyone in *robes*, but we did see some people with red sashes (which don't stand out that much, but we were forewarned).

We go for a sandwich and coffee at one of the stores around here.

red sash people look slightly healthier than neighborhood average, and look like workers.

Yala downs a silvertongue mutagen from Haskell and approaches a guy at random (who is eating stew). She asks him if his sash means what she thinks it does; is he going to the church thing tonight? he is, yes. Yala explains she heard a bit about this, was intrigued, even more so after seeing the sign over the church door. What's it like?

The guy explains: preacher is always saying they should get more people in, so anyone new is welcome. Services are very community oriented, people there as friends. It's a whole neighborhood thing, there's food and stuff; people who don't really believe are welcome too.

She thanks him, says she'll be there, and leaves him to his stew.

We're all going to the church. We don't dress any differently, though Haskell does cover up his more visible deformities a bit.

When we arrive, the gates are thrown wide open. Many attendees do wear the robes with red sash, but also many others are there in normal clothes.

It looks like it'll be pretty packed, to the extent some people will have to stand. Yala notices some interesting people walk in:
- the same soldiers that were talking to Bendren
- they're also wearing red sashes
- they would surely recognize Yala
She tries to hide, making it look natural. It doesn't work: one of them recognizes her, and shouts "omg! it's that elf! with the cannonball! the one I talked to you about!" She tries to deflect the attention, with absolutely zero success. The soldiers pull us to the front of the church, where a preacher wears a fancier set of robes, with a wider sash, middle-aged man with a very nondescript kind of face.

The soldier introduces Yala, stumbling over his words as well, explaining that she found the cannonball. The priest takes her aside and tries to convince her to tell the story, she manages to squirm out of doing so *today*, promising to do it tomorrow and to actually bring the cannonball that time while also emphasizing she wants to learn about this community first.
