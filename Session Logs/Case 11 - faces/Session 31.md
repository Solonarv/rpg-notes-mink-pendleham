Downtime two weeks:
- Yala: 10 days sewing work (it doesn't go well), 4 days improving our hideout as a home / shelter:
	- curtains or dividers so people have private spaces
	- a kitchen
	- including trying to make this work as a homeless shelter of sorts
	- disease: 27, 21, success
- Fabian: gathering rumors while ministering (and proselytizing) to the poor
- Artur: hitting the archives to re-train into Lore Master archetype
	- Prof. Mink doesn't approve, studies are too eclectic
		- Artur justifies this: you never know when something might have cross-disciplinary applications!
		- this works stunningly well, he gets recommendations and can thus finish early
	- disease: 17, fail -> stage 4; 28, crit success -> stage 3

Yala hears some things about the big fleshsmiths and starts pondering how to infiltrate their operations to maybe find out who caused this plague.

There is a ship, carrying a special fleshsmithing device that can change your face. It's supposed to be stuck in port, unable to leave. Perhaps we could steal it?

steps:
- find it
- plan a heist
- execute the heist

what we know:
- it exists
- name of the maker: Seral Akesi, dwarf, pretty up there but not *top* top fleshsmith. got killed fairly early during the pandemic, there was a bit of a gang war. this is one of the reasons the machine is still there: the people who might've sold it all died in that gang war.

finding it:
- based on general "type of docks," can narrow it down to about half of the coastline.

Yala remembers that Elisiteth exists, and goes to find her, hoping to engage her for info.

She returns to that place, where now more people live. Elisiteth is alive, but plagued, though she's not doing too bad.

Yala explains that we're after Akesi's stuff, and also that we can probably get them some food.

Elisiteth doesn't know all that much herself, but knows other people who know stuff. Together, she and Yala go around the docks, and make a list of some warehouses that Akesi owned/rented/used/operated.

Yala makes good on her promise, and delivers half of a week's worth of food (for 10 people, totaling 12 gp, split from the party funds).

Yala decides to hunt down a copy of *create food*. The book of standard spells at the university library has been stolen (all copies), and replaced by a card saying to call on a specific wizard who will teach the spell (at double the cost) (he stole them, of course).

NB: we could actually mostly feed these people, now

Yala ropes the rest of the party into stealing the books back from this wizard... next time!
