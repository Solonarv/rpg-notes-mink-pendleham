wizard had some loose paper notes from which he was teaching Yala. most likely he copied that spell onto those notes to avoid Yala sneaking a peek at any other spells.

appears to be working out of his home, he has a little office/workspace room there. No books in that room, he must keep them elsewhere; he brought in the notes one by one.

building has windows, but hard to tell which ones correspond to wizard's apartment.

Yala thinks this guy is a shitty wizard.

We take a day to prepare...

we will go to him posing as clients, looking to learn *mending*.

Yala rings the doorbell. It takes a while before he arrives.

The wizard is very careful, but does not have a truly secure door.

He makes Yala wait in the workroom while he fetches notes for mending.

She learns it in ten minutes flat, then leaves without making any further trouble.

However, as Artur is about to enter, Yala warp steps and slips past him, inside the apartment. Artur soon follows.

Round 1:
- Yala runs in and accuses the wizard of stealing the book of basic spells
- Artur runs in and casts *fear* on him. He fails.
- aaa no what are you doing! you fiends! he does a weird whistle and steps out of the apartment, locking it.
	- we roll some perception checks. Artur notices a gelatinous cube sliding down a trapdoor at the end of the hallway. it is very transparent.
Round 2:
- Yala finds the cube (this is not easy). She raises her shield.
- The cube schlorps past us (we make our reflex saves) and then slaps Artur for 4 bludgeoning. He's paralyzed.
- Artur is paralyzed, so he just spends his turn remembering Ooze Facts
	- he knows many Ooze Facts
		- no splitting
		- reflex weakest save
		- no weaknesses, resistance electricity
	- he unparalyzes at end of turn
- the wizard screams at us from the other side of the door
	- thieves! immoral! i hope you get eaten alive in there!
	- then he runs away
		- some other door somewhere in the corridor clicks
Round 3:
- yala needle darts, 18 hits for 14 p.
- the cube schlorps over us; Yala dodges (somehow), Artur gets engulfed for 5 acid.
	- this triggers his swallow-spike rune. it crits (the ooze has 10 AC), but oozes are immune to crits. It gets spiked for 13 p, which ruptures him out.
		- he still gets paralyzed though. even with a hero point!
- Artur would like to unsubscribe from Ooze Facts but he is too paralyzed to send the button.
	- what are the effects of critfail against paralyze? nothing special
	- he stares fixedly at the ceiling to maybe spot some traps? he spots none
	- ooze facts: it's mindless, it is not immune to sickened
- wizard is Doing Some Stuff outside of this room
Round 4:
- yala needle darts again, 27 crit for 14 p + 3 bleed.
- it schlorps over us again. artur just gets engulfed automatically (because paralyzed), yala also gets engulfed; we both take 7 acid. Yala doesn't get paralyzed.
	- Artur's swallow-spike rune hits the cube for 12, and it spits him out again.
	- Yala is suffocating
- Artur is still stuck in the Ooze Facts dimension
	- immune acid, crits, mental, precision, visual(no eyes)
	- he ponders the door: how do we leave when we're done here?
		- it probably has a security feature that makes the cube fall down if picked inexpertly
- wizard continues to ???
Round 5:
- Yala needle darts it from the inside, 21 crit for 11 p + get spit out.
- SCHLORP
	- we both take 10 acid
	- yala doesn't get paralyzed
	- swallowspike hard carry for 8 p
- artur finally unparalyzes
Yala:
- needle darts again, 17 hits for 14 p.
- SCHLORP
	- we both dodge, it bounces off the door
	- then it bleeds out the last bit of goop and dies

we check on each other. Artur heals himself, and Yala

Yala starts looking around for the books, but doesn't find them in the accessible rooms. One door is locked 

Artur tries to pick the lock, he breaks one set of picks but manages on the second attempt. Through it is the actual living space.

We enter, the wizard complains that we're still alive. He says "kill them, my minions!", snaps his fingers, and runs away again. Some steam elementals appear, looking like disturbingly happy little ghosts...

We get steam blasted by *four* of them!

Round N+6:
- Yala remembers the elementals' immunities
	- immune bleed, fire, paralyze, sleep, poison
	- needle darts one steam elemental, 16 hits for 17 p; almost kills it.
- Artur strides into the room, and *fears* everyone:
	- the elementals critfail ! frighten3, fleeing
	- the wizard fails, frighten2
- the wizard legs it
- the steam elementals flee into another room
	- it seems the wizard cut an additional hole between the living room and this extra room
Round N+7:
- Yala bursts into the living room, looks at the steam elementals in the bath
	- it's a bath? full of water, some of it steaming, the elementals are hanging out here.
		- concealment in this room
		- converted from an apartment entrance
	- she closes the door to the bath
	- looks around: are the books in the room with us?
- artur inspects the other door...
	- first, he casts his third *life boost* on himself
	- then he opens it, and finds a bedroom
		- very nice bed
		- no bookcases, but some books on the table/desk
- steam elementals are happy in the bath
Round N+8:
- Yala runs into the bedroom and starts inspecting the books...
- Artur does the same
Round N+9:
- finish inspecting books... counting books, journals
	- finished uni, wasn't having a lot of success as a novice wizard
		- brilliant idea: take these books
		- lotsa stuff to say about his customers
			- he doesn't like any of them
			- doesn't like yala's nose??
	- go to window
	- attempt to open window, it is the 6th floor

Mink has promised to tell us the name of this wizard... NEXT SESSION
