Haskell spent his downtime plying his trade as a fleshsmith. He finds us standing around stupidly outside the house, and joins us in staring dumbly for a while.

We discuss what happened, what went wrong, and what to do. Yala tries to shepherd the group away so we can chill out for a few hours, to no effect.

As we stand around talking, the ghost pokes her head out the wall, grins triumphantly and shakes her fist at us, then vanishes back into the house.

Yala noticed a restaurant, "the nameless cat", on the way here. Small restaurant, has an innkeeper with cat ears. She declares a need for a chair and a drink, then marches off there. The others follow.

While we're there, for a couple hours...
- Haskell hands out some alchemicals to us: drakeheart mutagens for Bendren and Yala; silvertongue mutagens for Artur and Yala.
- Bendren takes the time to bandage his wounds.
- We infodump onto Haskell everything he wasn't there for.
- Yala: hey innkeep, you seen Dr Brickell around lately? yeah, occasionally; she hasn't left her house in about a month though, just opened the door to accept deliveries and such.
- we discuss wtf to do
- Pendleham culture's view on spirits: nobody cares, really. culture too practical/self-centered. Pendleham has a very weak/barely-existent government, as a result controls on necromancy are practically nonexistent here.
- we speculate: perhaps Dr Derwyn Brickell killed her wife accidentally?
- Yala: innkeep! does Dr Brickell particularly like any of your dishes? He thinks for a bit and points out a set of cupcakes that she and her wife used to like. We deliberate for a bit and buy a dozen of them as a peace offering.

Yala and Haskell go over to Dr Brickell's house again to try and drag her out to the Nameless Cat. Yala downs her silvertongue mutagen and rings the bell. The ghost does the "I'm watching you" gesture at Yala, then Dr Brickell opens the door. The cupcakes and an impassioned plea from Yala gain us entrance and an invitation into the kitchen, which is very cozy and small. She pours us tea, while the ghost glowers at us with arms crossed.

Morgaine - the ghost - confirms that she is Morgaine, and the two are wife and wife. However, Morgaine shakes her head at Yala's guess that Morgaine died somehow. An argument between the two ensues. The living doctor insists she's fine; her wife disagrees. Yala sighs, "let's play twenty questions." Morgaine seems intrigued; Derwyn tries to 

Haskell tries to relate to Derwyn by mentioning he too dabbles in fleshsmithing, and points out his own state.
Derwyn snarks about them not working anymore; Morgaine shrugs unrepentantly.
- Morgaine, are you dead? Morgaine: no; Derwyn: not exactly; evades elaboration.
- Morgaine, do you have a physical body? Yes
- You're not inhabiting it; can't, or don't want to? the second, ish, but it's a weird question.
Derwyn is getting increasingly upset and throws us out frantically (and verbally). Haskell manages to have Flamelli squirrel himself away somewhere. Thanks to a distraction from Haskell (one of his extra limbs knocking something over), Yala manages to whisper to Morgaine: meet us at the front door in an hour. Morgaine gives her a considering look, and we let ourselves get rushed out.

Flamelli pokes around, eavesdropping/watching the discussion between Derwyn and Morgaine that is sure to follow.

We return to the Nameless Cat and update the others on our discussion. Yala also thanks the innkeeper for the tip with the cupcakes.

Artur speculates that the couple might have been doing some manner of immortality experiments that went wrong. We put our heads together about this. Haskell and Yala just vaguely recall people trying or researching this. Presumably you could set up some unfinished business, then die and hope to become a ghost as a result. Artur has actually come across a more solid piece of lore, about how fleshsmithing relates to the soul. Specifically, body tissues count as "part of the same body" only for about a week after being removed, and during this time they can be used as an anchor for the soul if kept alive. He has heard of someone using this effect to anchor their own soul and move it around.

we meet Morgaine at the front door. Message exchange:
- can you respond to this spell? no
- anywhere better to talk? points toward garden
- meet you there? she vanishes.

We all go around to the garden, though Bendren stands a distance away. Morgaine joins us there.
- I assume Derwyn doesn't know you're talking to us? shrug.
- Are we on the right track with the immortality idea? no
- Is there something wrong with your body? other than your spirit not being in it. - Yes.
- Illness? No
- Injury? ehhh kinda
- Is whatever's wrong with your body preexisting, or a consequence of whatever left you a spirit? she's uncertain how to answer.
- Is Derwyn working on fixing whatever's wrong with your body? - you crazy? no.
- Do you think it's possible for us to help Derwyn or you? yes.
- Does Derwyn think we can help? shrug, vaguely annoyed
- Haskell: why can't you talk? points at her neck, cutting motion
- Bendren sets out a writing set; Morgaine's telekinesis is too clumsy for that.
- Bendren scrawls out a ouija board for Morgaine to point at.

This allows her to tell the story, slowly. She and Derwyn had a fight because she learned that Derwyn isn't a real doctor, doesn't have a degree. Dr Morgaine, as an upstanding and honorable citizen of Pendleham, wanted to inform their previous clients. Derwyn refused, hit her in the head, and locked her in the basement. She's still down there. Can you go into the basement and let me out? It's very annoying to not be able to move around.

Morgaine tells us which door leads to the basement

Will Derwyn fight us? shrug.

Can Morgaine open a window or something? nah.... maybe by breaking it? No spare key either.

Where's the basement key? Derwyn's keyring. Where does she keep it when sleeps? by the door.

Morgaine distracts Derwyn with another argument. Haskell has Flamelli take the keys from the front door and let us in. We go into the basement and get Morgaine out, with Derwyn none the wiser.

We execute this plan immediately. We hear shouting, and some noise. Then there's an even louder commotion, and everything goes quiet. Flamelli seems to be asleep.

Change of plans: we rush in. For this, we must first get in. We manage to feed her a sufficiently convincing line about retrieving Flamelli and not being after her fleshsmithing secrets, so she opens the doors to hand the wayward familiar back.

We take this opportunity to bumrush her. begin combat!
Artur: evil eye on Derwyn, she succeeds. also grab: 14 fails.
Haskell: stride in. grab: 20, success.
Bendren: guidance self. stride in. grab: 14 fails.
Derwyn: escape Haskell, 17 success. complain, Morgaine shows up and is smug. Cast a spell at Haskell (BONE RATTLER), fort save: 20 succeeds for 10/2=5 bludgeoning.
Yala: protective wards. befuddle derwyn, she succeeds: clumsy 1, stupefied 1.

Round 2.
Haskell: grapple, 14 fail. again, 21 success. demoralize, it fails and sends her into a rant. Morgaine throws a decorative shelf at her.
Bendren: trip, 14 fail. grab again, critfail, fall prone. stand.
Artur: {griffin exits satchel}. cast evil eye, this prolongs clumsy and stupefied. she fails, now sickened 1. cast void warp: she critfails, 6Ã—2=12 void damage, enfeebled.
Morgaine manages to keep her temper at this sudden aggression... barely.
Derwyn: escape haskell, 5 nope. He's able to leverage this into a proper lock and we get her restrained.

We go in, lock the doors, and dump Derwyn in a corner to glare at her. We send Haskell down the stairs by himself, since Morgaine assures us there are no traps. She leads him to a room where he finds a body that's clearly hers, tied to a table and seemingly asleep. Her spirit reinhabits her body and she seems to wake up.
Haskell frees her. She gets up, stretches - clearly not entirely healthy, but she was fed intravenously. She picks up a ball of flesh from a nearby table and stabs its pointed tentacle into her spine. These are her vocal cords, extracted into this device so she can talk.

She storms upstairs, and just lays into her wife verbally for all the things she did. Morgaine seems to be the only honest person in Pendleham.

Haskell suggests: I don't think the people who helped me were honest about their qualifications. But still, if they hadn't helped me I would be so much worse. Maybe you could help her get certified.
Yala chimes in: Mme Arlette considers her a useful asset for fleshsmithing work, surely that says something about her skills.
Bendren: as long as no harm is done....
Artur isn't a huge believer in certifications anyway.

We encourage them to stay together (since it seems they both want to), and play down the importance of the ultimately arbitrary certification.

We return to Mme Arlette's, who thanks us for the help and pays us.

The fleshsmiths give us each one free consultation/procedure.

Thus concludes: *A Shard of Love*.
