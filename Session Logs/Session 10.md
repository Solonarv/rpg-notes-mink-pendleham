We flip Arrissanne's coin, together, in our secret lab. At first nothing happens, and we look around stupidly for a bit, until we notice one of the shadows lengthening, bubbling, and forming into an upright smoky figure lit by red light from within.

The figure introduces itself as Arrissanne, in a very humanlike voice. We introduce ourselves as well, and Yala asks after our line of credit: the balance, currently:
Yala: 80 Haskel: 10 Bendren: 55 Artur: 20

Yala also asks what else Arrissanne trades in. Creepy laugh: anything, make a request and I'll figure it out. It asks whether we want to buy anything right now.

We demur, since we want to think about what we can afford first. Arrissanne notes that pretty much everyone does this when they first get the coin, but soon they start to keep track. And perhaps we want to do a little something to get ahead, mmm? It gives us a price list of the most popular runes in our estimated wealth bracket.

We discuss and come to the conclusion that we'll pool our discounts to get Haskell a rune of +1 armor potency (160 gp) plus 10gp fee for applying. We spend all of our 165gp discount, and Haskell pays the remaining 5Ã—1.2=6 gp. It'll be done in 2 days.

We also try to figure out what's up with the ivory mustelid card. Bendren has nothing, except that it's probably not religious. Artur notes that it's similar to a tarot or solitaire card but also has nothing specific.

Days pass...

We hear rumor of people wondering what happened at the auction house. The consensus seems to be that someone dropped a candle or the like, and so the 
The owners deny this, claiming sabotage from their competitors or attempted theft or something, but there's a lot of uncertainty.
Yala contributes by writing scathing articles about the lack of fire safety, sticking scrupulously to the facts.

First week of downtime:
- Yala earn income @ level 5, success: 9 sp/day -> 6.3 gp; -2 gp cost of living
- Artur research about the mustelid card. He finds some references to magic items that are shaped like cards, or shaped like mustelids - lots of the latter, actually, since one of the professors - Prof. Mink - at the Athenaeum is obsessed with mustelids. Lots and lots of leads, no good way to sort through them and none really stand out.
- Haskell crafts tracking tags for future use; on things we find, and on later fleshsmithed creations. He decides to use a stamping machine, which breaks. He spends the rest of the week trying to repair the machine and looking for the right type of steel and so on. This whole endeavor costs him 10 gp, but at least now he can't fuck up again.
- Bendren investigates the rat gun. He makes a rat and takes care of it for the week to see how it lasts. It's a gun rat, and has a tendency to shoot its food before it starts eating.

Second week:

Yala earn income @ level 3, success: 5 sp/day -> 3.5 gp; -2 gp cost of living
finishing up the article about the sewer monster

Artur goes visit Prof. Mink, who's very excited to have someone interested in ferrets and proves absolutely impossible to redirect back to the topic of the card. By the end of the day, Artur finds himself signed up to the professor's lectures, his mind burning with information about ferrets.
On the following days, he does go to the lectures.The lectures set his head spinning (and he gets Lore: Ferrets for his trouble). He tries a few more times to get information about the mustelid card, and does eventually get the professor on topic. They've actually worked together; Mink complains that Vangerhripfen is a terrible academic, never writing anything down. Mink doesn't think it summons a ferret or anything like it, since Vangerhripfen studied daemons and the body-soul connection. He doesn't recognize the card, but thinks it's probably a spirit thing. Maybe it summons a giant ferret spirit, who knows?

Haskell earns income and does exceptionally well: 4.8 gp

Bendren does his job. He too does exceptionally well.

We make some plans to deal with the horrid beastie in the extradimensional lab.

We ponder sending in the rat from the gun. Yala's educated guess: closing the door will disrupt the connection, it'd be fine to leave it open though.

Artur suggests selling the beastie: find someone who harvests "waste" creatures, and get them to take it off our hands.

We find a cave in the countryside. There, according to Yala's detailed plans, we set up a door, a wooden beam to brace it, etc so that we can send Artur's familiar (Griffin) inside to scout via share senses, and leave the door open just a sliver to prevent the monster's escape while leaving the familiar connection intact.

We execute the plan. Artur sees:
20x20x20 feet cubical room. The door exits onto a catwalk that goes around the room, overlooking a lab space. It all looks kind of beaten up. In the middle is a big glass tank, shattered from the inside. In the remains of pseudo-amniotic fluid sits a giant frog, larger than a horse, dark green warty skin, very wide jaw, its eyes on the familiar. It croaks, loudly. As the familiar advances a little more, the frog's tongue shoots out and pulls Griffin into its mouth. Chomp, chomp, chomp, no more familiar.

Artur thinks about the frog. It seems to have gills, so it can probably breathe water. Has a lot of HP. He does some more research, too: fleshsmiths often don't just make the whole creature by themselves, rather they buy or contract out specific organs/limbs to specialists. The gills are the work of a guy specializing in poison-resistant creatures, so it probably has resistance poison 10 at least. The hard rubbery skin also resists punching.

Yala tries to contact the gill supplier. She talks to the secretary, puts in a request, and eventually gets a form response listing off the poisons these gills are rated against.

Artur asks Prof. Mink if he knows the guy; he does, and doesn't like him, has very low opinions of him and his work on poison resistance. Mink also complains that none of his creatures are even ferrets! they're terrible!
Artur explains a bit more about the creature. In the process, he sets off another rant/lecture on how awful this guy is, complete with a diagram, but he just barely manages to redirect him away. Prof. Mink gives Artur the book he wrote on how terrible the poison resistance guy is. 

Yala looks for a creature merchant who might be interested in the frog. She gets a few names, manages to eliminate the ones who would fuck us over, and eventually narrows the list down to one: a lady who has a smallish lab, close to the docks, who recently was going around asking for big muscles, skin, and such on a budget.
