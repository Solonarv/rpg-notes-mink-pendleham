2 weeks of downtime. we spend it on cleaning up and inventorying the extradimensional lab.

We have a few spare days after we're done.
- Bendren checks on Rian
- Yala relaxes in the baths
- Haskell checks on his debts and takes Flamelli to a familiar park. He actually tries to pay off some of the debt too. He now has a week to bring the bursar two livers.
- Artur - baths as well. together with Yala

on the way to the baths (not the cheapest, safe enough to not worry about getting our livers scooped out; but not breaking the bank either), Artur and Yala get interrupted by Prof. Mink (who's also going there). The professor asks where Artur's been, after missing a whole week of lectures. He recommends getting undergrads for this sort of work.

Loaned out a set of notes about a ferret-cleaning device. He wants it back, and tugs at the favor Artur owes him. The loaner is a guy who used to have a lab not far from the port, then suddenly died - very unfortunate decision on his part, some kind of mixup with another fleshsmith. Should still be in his lab, Mink has a rough location. Job: break in, take the notes, grab whatever else is in there as a reward. Artur agrees to this.

We crosscheck's Mink's location info against the maps of the docks and sewers that we have, which allows us to pinpoint the lab.

We case the area on the street level; the lab is underground and not (easily) accessible from street level. Bendren puts his ear to the street to ask about who the owner of that lab might be. Nathaniel Trapp. Used to be a civil engineer type of fleshsmith; not so much creatures, more so labyrinths, buildings, etc. Lots of people contracted him with jobs like "we need this thing built for a creature we're making".

Bendren finds us a path through the sewers. It's not amazing, but at least we don't have to swim. Flamelli is on share senses + manual dex today.

We exit the sewers into a dry(ish) network of utility tunnels, which connect to the lab. Yala casts *invisibility* on the little guy and we send him in to scout, carrying a *light*ed stone and a cloth to cover it. As he approaches the door, he hears voices. Sound like a couple people talking to each other. Flamelli opens the door after setting the lit stone down a bit away. As he goes through, he sees: this doesn't look like a lab, it seems to have been cleared out. There are some tents in a big room, which Haskell doesn't recognize. They look fairly well-made, but seem to have been in use for quite a while. Further in, he sees two people (from the back), fishing in a square-ish pool; they have a (small) lantern.

Flamelli sneaks further. He sees another tent; then a massive door of steel and hardened bone, probably the entrance into the lab proper; some crates against the walls. He continues exploring: more tents, some kind of kitchen. Two doors. He approaches the two people to eavesdrop, who immediately notice the disembodied light.

Haskell recognizes the woman: she helped us in the bar when we were tracking the monster in the docks, introduced us to some other people. [[Session 05]]
Her name is (now? newly? actually?) Elisiteth.

She says to her companion, "I don't like this" and backs away from the light. Flamelli covers the light with the cloth and retreats. He closes the door on the way back.

We discuss what to do, and decide to try diplomacy. Yala goes up to the door and knocks. No response. Open the door, call a tentative "helloooo?" into the room. No response.

Yala continues: we're just passing through, we mean you no harm, etc. No response.

Haskell gets oiled up (life-boosting oil)

With shields raised and eyes peeled, we cautiously proceed through the door. The lamp and people are gone, seeming to have vanished. We continue to the door. It's a huge, sturdy vault door.

Haskell investigates the door's mechanism, with a pile of bonuses from most of us. It seems to be nonfunctional, which is unfortunate because he could probably crack it otherwise. The door uses blood pistons to move, but since there's no blood pressure and no power to pump the blood, it won't move. It also seems to be sick and would need to be healed first. Looking around, he notices pipes leading away in one direction, and wires in the other direction.

We follow the pipes, since Flamelli saw no people there. As we exit the vault door's chamber, we see three people; one of them is Elisiteth, who recognizes us and wonders wtf we're doing here. Yala explains nonchalantly that we have a mission to get a thing from inside the vault.

She asks, somewhat worriedly (and glancing at our armaments/gear) what we intend with the money in here. The other two - still cautious - do introduce themselves: Derka and Gelina.

Yala reassures them that we have no intention of murdering them for their money or anything like that. Elisiteth notes that they've been living here a while; it's Pendleham, always hard to find somewhere to sleep where you won't get your liver scooped out (Haskell miraculously manages to keep a poker face at this coincidence). They offer help carrying stuff (clearly angling to get a share of the loot). Yala says sure, they're welcome to it.

Two more people appear, also dressed scruffily. One has glowing eyes (symptom of a popular drug, not good for you, decent high), broad shoulders, a bit more confidence; the other is a 13yo kid. He ask what's going on here, who are these people? The girl steps forward and tries to look even more confident.

Artur tries to calmly explain that we mean no harm and will just leave as soon as we're done here. This goes better than Yala's attempt. Also, Elisiteth vouching for us helps.

The guy is Letek. He has a small lab here, cooks some alchemicals and sells it; they have a small community here. The girl looks like she wants to convince us that she's not afraid of any monsters in any labs, but she's clearly terrified. She introduces herself as Mael the Magnificent. She also wonders why we're covered in shit. Yala responds, "good point. why *are* we covered in shit?" and casts prestidigitation, to Mael's amazement.

We follow the pipes, which leads us through a door to more corridors. Bendren manages to follow the pipes' path through the rat's nest of other pipes. We eventually arrive at a door with a sign above designating it as the blood pump room. Haskell opens it. As we gaze in, we see it's very dilapidated. The ceilign collapsed at some point. There's a walkway next to the door, which used to have a ladder leading to the lower level; but now the lower level is flooded with blood. The walkway is also partly collapsed.

There's some kind of green sludgy liquid dripping from the ceiling that's also eating through the walkway. Yala barely manages to stop herself before stepping into it. There are a few more spots of dripping acid.

She jumps across to the central island (which is full of machinery, and ). A small object flies at her face, like an alchemical bomb. Initiative!

- green cloak: the bomb hits; explodes; produces a strong rush of air that would've knocked her over, but she kept her footing. Another bomb comes flying, and misses. The thrower disappears into a small hatch leading to a ventilation pipe.
- Haskell: stride through the acid, eating (reflex success) 13/2=6 acid damage; as he steps on the end of the walkway, part of it shears off, and a pipe spurts out a burst of blood; reflex success 10/2=5 bludg damage, and he keeps his footing. He leaps across the gap to join Yala, and falls on his ass. Then he 
- Yala: reposition. protective wards. raise shield.
- Bendren: move. extend steely feathers. do nothing.
- Artur: take out bedroll to protect head from acid. stride through acid; reflex success, 5/2=2 damage, poor bedroll we hardly knew ye. He leaps across onto the central island, and lands on his feet.

Suggestion for next session: try talking
