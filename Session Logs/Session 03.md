dowtime:

Yala learns lots of spells and buys some equipment.

Bendren turns Adrian's brain into a brain beast, named Brian (on a monkey body).

Artur also learns some spells.

### The Next Case
on this bright sunny day, we're once again gather at Mme Arlette's auberge.
As we feast on aubergines for lunch(?), Mme Arlette approaches us with another job. She was impressed with our handling of the Adrian affair, so she's willing to give us something a bit more delicate.
She has a big network of friends in the city. One of them is Dr Derwyn Brickell. Fleshsmith of quite some skill, does implants and healing mostly. Very convenient person to know, doesn't ask too many questions. Unfortunately, for about 3 weeks she hasn't been working - wife left her or something, very unclear, clinic closed and not accepting clients. This would be fine, only she owes Mme Arlette money (from loan, which the doctor hasn't defaulted on yet), and the under-the-table healing is also quite useful to Mme Arlette.
The wife's name is/was Morgaine (sp?).
So, she asks us to go there, check up on why she's no longer working, maybe resolve whatever issue is preventing her from working.
Mme Arlette gives us the address of the clinic, and a letter to the doctor, then sends us off.
The address is on the other side of the river. Naturally, we take the train.

It takes about 10 minutes for us to reach the train station where we have to change lines. The train crossing the river is down on a lower level, and that part of the station is quite humid and a bit dilapidated. this train is also shaped differently from the overground trains.

overgroud: open carriage, many legs, feel the wind
underground: sealed, has some flippers on the back. doors open with a hiss of air exchange. not many people use this train. we do get in though.

at first it skitters down the tunnel just like the overground trains, then dives into a pool and swims through the tunnel - it seems the tunnels are now flooded, the city's decline having led to leaks and such.

We chitchat about the state of the train network a bit.

We soon make our way to the clinic, which is called the Brickell fleshworks.

pretty large building, 2 floors, looks kinda expensive but not outrageously so. door is locked, but has a doorbell. There is light shining from the second floor. The building has a small strip of garden surrounding it, but there isn't much space because of surrounding buildings.

Bendren rings the doorbell, for a good while. Eventually there is shuffling and a voice says "we're not taking visitors, we're closed, you'll have to go to a different practice."
Artur responds that we're checking in to see what's going on, says that Mme Arlette was concerned for Dr Brickell. Also proposes to help if there are any issues.
Dr Brickell denies this, insists everything's fine, she has it under control and will pay her loans on time. As she says this, there is a crash of glass which makes her jump.
Bendren tries to lean on friendly connections to get us invited in for tea. somewhat surprisingly, this works.
She wears loose white robes and a simple golden mask over her face, matching the description Mme Arlette gave us. She seems quite nervous and hurried as she does.
The front doors are surprisingly fortified.
Dr Brickell leads us into a small room, probably usually the waiting room. As most first-floor windows, these are barred.
Dr Brickell's hands are shaking, she's not doing well, something has her freaked out.
She sits us down, asks how she can help us. Yala bluntly states that Mme Arlette was worried and she was clearly right. As Dr Brickell denies this once again, there is another crash from upstairs and she runs off to deal with it.
As we wait, a brain beast scurries in, bringing tea using a platter balanced on top of it. Amazingly, not a drop is spilled as the beast jumps onto the table.

We wait for a while, perhaps 10 minutes. There is no unexpected magic in the room - just the lamp.

We hear another loud crash, pretty much directly overhead. Unanimously, we take this as our cue to go upstairs and investigate. We see a small corridor with most of the doors closed; Dr Brickell is in a room with an open door, backed against a wall, facing off against a glowing transparent figure of a woman, floating in midair. She also has a lampstand hovering a few feet in front of her, then flings at at Dr Brickell, who dodges and lets it shatter against the wall. This is obviously a ghost or something similar. Bendren quickly casts forced mercy on the ghost. The ghost turns to Bendren, opening its mouth in a silent scream, and casts a spell on him: a ball of water forms around its hand and flies at Bendren's face, then again.

At this point Yala addresses Dr Brickell, clearly everything is not fine! the doctor whirls around, asks us what we're doing here; Yala explains that we heard a crash, deduced (correctly!) that everything isn't fine, and went to investigate.

We enter combat.
Round 1:
ghost - (skip, already done)
Bendren - 2⋄ heal self for 18, start to head down
Yala - raise shield, protective wards, start to head down. also talk to dr brickell.
Artur - cast shield, move toward stairs
Round 2:
ghost - float towards us slowly. same spell again: bendren get splashed for 8 b.
Dr Brickell - stands in front of us, telling us to go away.
Bendren - 1⋄ RK: he has a PhD in ghosts. He knows: usually they come from unfinished business, someone who died. They're cleared with a special ritual, or find the item the ghost is tied to and burning it. Usually this is the corpse, and it has to be burned thoroughly. Ghosts usually can't stray too far from that item, typically on the order of 120 ft. 1⋄ diplomance: I will do what I can to help you find peace and move on. The ghost doesn't appreciate the idea of moving on and hates him even more now.
Yala - hey Dr Brickell, this is your wife right? Dr Brickell denies it frantically (and unconvincingly). Yala sustains protective wards, raises her shield, and continues down the stairs.
Artur - conceal spell, evil eye the ghost: it ?. walk down the stairs.
Round 3:
Dr Brickell exhorts us to leave, quickly.
ghost - phases through the ceiling, casts a spell at Bendren. His bones shake a bit, but he shrugs off the effect.
Bendren - cast divine lance at the ghost (!!), it goes wide (crit miss). guidance on artur.
Yala - hiss at Bendren to stop trying to murder the doctor's wife *again*. try to convince the ghost that we're trying to help, but combat stress prevents the words from coming out.
Artur - cackle, sustain evil eye. cast command (run away) at the ghost. cast shield.
Round 4:
ghost - flees as ordered, through the floor. quickly returns though, rising up again, even madder now. flies at artur menacingly.
Dr Brickell runs to the inner front door and unlocks it.
Bendren - delay
Yala - stride to inner front door, open it, sustain aura
Bendren - move toward front door, ready to rush out. cast shield.
Artur - move into entrance hallway, cast shield, sustain evil eye.
Round 5:
Dr Brickell unlocks the outer front door.
ghost - approaches menacingly. cast something at Bendren again, he fails the save: takes 7 damage as his bones start to shake and rattle inside his body.
Yala - sustain wards, open front door and run out.
Bendren - run out.
Artur - run out.

the ghost does not pursue us.
