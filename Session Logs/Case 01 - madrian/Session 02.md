We enter into an antechamber, pretty clearly in disrepair - cracks in the walls, moss.

sounds: just machinery and pump noises.

Doors:
- right - where we came in
- south - storage?
- left - main lab space.

quick peek into the storage space. bunch of boxes, crates, bits of wiring and metal and pipes. also cages, one of them contains an armored brain beast.
Bendren notices that some of those crates and shelves are cages/kennels, and there are faint rustling sounds. He creeps in to get a better look. Haskell follows him in.
Bendren knocks on the crate, which falls silent. He asks if anyone is in there, and the silence continues.
Yala and Artur exhort the other two to leave the rustling crates alone for now, while we check out the rest of the facility; they'll surely keep. This eventually gets through. We close the door to the storage room again.

left, toward the main lab space. this is actually also a storage room, though drier and better maintained. buncha metal devices. Yala recognizes those are parts for fluid handling devices - pumping, storing, fountaining, etc.
Haskell finds no signs of people here, but the dirty floor indicates foot traffic between the door north and the entrance we used, and less foot traffic between the door north and the storage room at the south.

door north: Haskell opens it. Beyond is a lab, with bookshelves full of notes, glassware containing strange liquids, a big glass tank with a brain floating in it. stepping in, on the left: desk, blackboards, plans/blueprints for fleshsmithing. more glass tanks, some containing body parts in various levels of disassembly. room seems to be empty otherwise.
Haskell checks through the notes on the desk.

Yala peeks behind the dividing wall, where she finds a cot, part of a small living area. There's a cage sized to fit a human, but not currently containing one.

POIs:
- glass tank w/ brain; Yala, Bendren: seems to be an incubation chamber growing a brain beast. growing legs around the central brain. as it bobs around, it turns to as and gazes at us with still-growing eyes, scratches at the tank trying to get out. Yala also notices some mechanisms behind the tank, embedded into the wall. Unsurprisingly, Yala can't deduce what species it belongs to. 
- notes on desk and blackboard; Haskell and Artur: figure out the entire process here, get a good overview. take human brains, use them in the brain beasts. had plans for producing them in large quantity. note mention a Mister G who was going to supply the brains. Also, notes on modifications trialled on the brain beasts, rather odd ones: poison, hardened carapaces, micromanipulator arms (would be for... clocks?), grippers for climbing, special ears. There is also a list of who the brains came from; a fair number of them are unsourced though.
- small living area; Yala found it. Haskell goes to check it out. Whoever's been living here was doing so for a while, and was just one person.
- alchemical storages near walls; Artur checks it out. The substances are mostly pretty standard, there are also some plug-and-play organs for attaching to brains; there's also some physical augmentations, modified glands and such. He picks them up, as well as two flasks of alchemist's fire.

Yala realizes something very important: this place was supposed to be the pump room for the fountain. But there are no pumps here! Haskell remembers that the maps indicate another room to the north.

Yala ponders the lever behind the brain beast tank. It probably activates some mechanism, or perhaps opens a heavy door. Hard to tell precisely since much of the mechanism is embedded into the wall.

Haskell pulls the lever. The steel plates on the wall hinge and slide apart, revealing a larger room beyond. In the distance is a man working at an operating table, and a couple brain beasts slide apart. The sound in the room - pumps, machinery, fluid - hits us like a solid wall. The guy seems to not notice us, the opening of the door drowned out by the noise.

Yala pokes her head in for a better look. She finds no great surprises. The bodies:
- right: deformed, flesh warped.
- left: hard to tell because the fleshsmith is in the way, humanoid enough though.

As we deliberate, a familiar-ish brain beast pops out of a hatch and scuttles up to the guy. The one who escapes. It clicks at him and waves its arms around, in a specialized sign language fleshsmiths use for communicating with their brain beasts. The man is irritated, shouts "what! intruders!".
Haskell steps in and makes himself known, after downing a silvertongue mutagen he quickly mixes up.

The man whirls around, accuses us of intruding, attacking Misgan's apartment, ruining his plans. Haskell agrees this was us, says we are looking for Misgan: his parents are worried, sorry to interrupt your work.
They guy laughs: you are looking for Misgan, muahahaha! you have found him! He steps away from the table, allowing us to recognize the body he was operating on: it's Misgan, strapped down with his skull cut open. You're too late! I will have my revenge, or my name is not Adrian von Brahm! He flips a lever, and machinery starts pumping some strange glowing liquid into Misgan.

On general principles, we probably have around a minute before the glowing liquid does whatever it does. We engage combat.

Bendren draw pistol. Shoot von Brahm, 16 miss. Stride up to Yala.
Von Brahm pulls out a giant crossbow, fires at Haskell. 29 crit for 20 p, ow! strides back a bit.
Artur delays.
Yala casts runic weapon on Bendren's gun and steps aside.
Artur acts: strides in, casts needle darts at the nearest brain beast: 22 hit for 5 p. This seems to half-kill it already. His goose flaps around near the ceiling.
Haskell consumes the silvertongue mutagen to heal for 6 hp. He has Flamelli feed him a juggernaut mutagen, then raises his shield.
The brain beasts raise their tails(?) and spit something (acid? venom?) at Artur, but none of the projectiles hit. The brain beast that tattled on us just hides.

Round 2!
Bendren reloads, shoots von Brahm: 16 miss. 1⋄ heal on Haskell for 3 hp.
Von Brahm reloads, shoots Artur: 19 hit for 12 p. reloads again.
Yala: 3⋄ magic missile at the mechanisms pumping fluids into Misgan. Total 13 damage, effective 8. von Brahm isn't a fan.
Artur strides into range, electric arc the two venomspitter brain beasts for 3 lightning; both fail. Neither are destroyed. His goose flies ahead.
Haskell runs down, raises his shield, demoralize von Brahm (13, fail).
Brain beasts spit at Haskell. Another that was hiding on a pump reveals itself by joining the spitfest, and has no more luck than the first two.

Round 3!
Bendren reloads, shoots the mechanism: 12 hit for 7 p. This is just enough to break it. Adrian is really pissed now. He reloads again.
Von Brahm shoots Bendren, 18 hit for 7 p. Reloads, shoots again: 13 miss.
Yala: slashing gale the already-damaged brain beasts, finishing them off. cast protective wards.
Artur repositions, then casts needle darts on the remaining venomspitter brain beast: 27 crit for 12 p. It dies. His goose flies toward von Brahm.
Haskell runs toward von Brahm, right up to his face.
Another brain beast that was hiding on the other pump spits at Artur, 26 hits him this time. This deals no damage but pulls him closer, into the pool of blood. It then hides. The snitch jumps out behind Haskell and begins to rip and tear: 27 crit for 6 p, fort save ok. second bite misses.

Round 4!
Bendren fires a wildly improbable shot at the brain beast that grabbed Artur; 20 hits for 9 p. It dies.
Von Brahm swaps his crossbow for a giant wrench, with which he bonks Haskell. 9 misses, 21 hits for 12 b. Haskell falls.
Yala sustains her protective aura, then runs toward Haskell.
Artur struggles against the current, and with some effort manages to drag himself up onto the ledge. Griffin flies just a bit closer to von Brahm.
The snitch brain beast runs at Yala and flails at her ineffectively.

Round 5!
Bendren shoot von Brahm, miss. Reload, shoot again, miss again.
Haskell fails his recovery check.
Von Brahm runs at Yala and bonks her, 27 crit for 26 b. ow. down.
Artur casts command on von Brahm, who makes his save. He strides away.
The snitch brain beast follows Artur and bites. 21 hits for 4 p, fort save fails. again, 7 misses.

Round 6!
Bendren closes the distance a bit. casts flense on the snitch brain beast. 26 hits and kills it.
Haskell critically succeeds his recovery check, and stabilizes.
Yala fails her recovery check.
Von Brahm moans about Bendren destroying his brain beast, and bonks artur: 29 hit for 28 b, he's down. Walks up to Bendren, ready with his wrench.

Round 7
Bendren heals Yala and Artur for 1 hp.
Yala gets up, casts shield, and retreats.
Artur gets up, tries to cast evil eye, but is stupefied. He moves away. Griffin flies around a bit.
Adrian bonks Beldren, 30 crit for 14 b. again, 12 miss.

Round 8
Bendren reloads and shoots von Brahm. 17 misses. He tries and fails to shove von Brahm into the pool.
Haskell, now awake: consume jugg mutagen. quick alch elixir of life, consume it.
Yala: drink Haskell's drakeheart mutagen, cast slashing gust at Adrian: 23 hit for 4 s.
Artur: evil eye von Brahm, he succeeds on the save. cast fear, save succeeds: frightened 1.
von Brahm: bonk Bendren, 23 hit for 11 b, Bendren down.

Round 9.
Haskell: delay
Yala: stride to flank with Haskell, cast grease on von Brahm's weapon.
Haskell reenters: gets up, punches von Brahm: 25 hit for 5 b. again, 9 miss.
Artur: walk down, evil eye von Brahm. He succeeds again. Griffin flies around.
Bendren fails his recovery check.
von Brahm: steps out of flanking. bonk haskell, 21 hit for 11 b, down again. bonk yala, 19 miss.

Round 10.
Yala: cast shield. cast slashing gust @ von Brahm, 28 crit for 10 s + 1d4 bleed.
Artur: evil eye adrian, he CRIT fails. needle darts, 15 misses.
Bendren fails his recovery check.
Haskell succeeds on his recovery check and stabilizes.
von Brahm: retch, down to sickened 1. try to retch again, no dice. bonk Yala: 27 hit, she's down again. 

Round 11.
Artur: cackle. throw alch fire next to von Brahm, he gets singed by the splash. Run away for 2 actions.
Bendren ?? recovery check.
Haskell wakes up again. gets up. punches von Brahm, 9 miss. again, 9 miss.
Yala fails her recovery check.
von Brahm chases after Artur.

Round 12.
Artur: cackle. runrunrun across the room.
Bendren is stable and delays.
Haskell raises his shield and tries to first-aid Yala.
Bendren shoots von Brahm, misses. reloads, shoots again, misses again.
Yala fails her recovery check and uses a hero point to stay alive.
von Brahm goes after Haskell, running with all three actions. Then he dies to the persistent bleeding.

XP: 120, #TotalXP 240
Loot: some. Also, von Brahm's head.

We untie Misgan, who thanks us profusely and vows to change his ways.

We rest up and patch up our wounds a little in the lab/living space, before heading back outside.

We take him back to Mme Arlette, and complain about how hard the job was. Over the next few days, we recover, receive our payment from Misgan's parents, and sell von Brahm's head. We also gather and sell the various pulped brain beasts' brains.

We get two weeks of downtime after this.
