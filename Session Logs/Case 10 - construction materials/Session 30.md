discussion!

satisfaction:
- shrooms- missing context for what we're doing, overarching objective?
	- not rly lol
	- would be good to have more of that
- solo- same, and also meeting frequency
	- feels disconnected
	- hard to get engaged
- dab-
	- like reading a book where 3 protags are doing different things, surely it'll tie together in the end but it's not like you KNOW
	- character build (skill issue) (retraining will fix it)

topics of game content:
- tone: more serious adventure about ills of this failing city, different power brokers
	- tone is great
	- dont really see much of the latter
- self-mod: was voted highly
	- not very much of it? just doesnt seem to come up often
- the lab:
	- we haven't worked on the lab much in downtime
- combat:
	- maybe a little more? -shrooms
	- hard because it takes up so much time
- puzzles:
	- decent
	- retrospective on the green cloak fight
- socials: yeah pretty good
- influence on the setting:
	- mixed results so far, feels kinda like things just happened and also we were there
	- not much where we decided to do a thing and then stuff happened as a result

options from here:
- focus on the plague: how, why? several past adventures tie into this
	- find out the reason
	- seek out a solution
- the lab, outfitting it, turning it into a big fleshsmithing lab, make a big kaiju and trample over the city or ???
	- why are kaiju always lizards, anyway?
	- become big important fleshsmiths
- yala investigations: things happening in the docks
	- the snatcher
	- journalism/investigation plot
- try to escape from the city
	- difficult with the blockade
- free space

- shrooms- likes plague focus

there must've been some high-level plan with the manufacturing of this plague.
- architect built the lab where the plague was made
- this must've been premeditated somehow
- we could go undercover, work for different fleshsmiths, try to figure out which one might've done this
- loop in the self-mod stuff
	- infiltration buffs? switch face and such
- community/base-building
	- how do we pay them?
