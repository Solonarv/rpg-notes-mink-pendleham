We discuss whether to reveal the lab's existence to Mme Arlette, and come down in favor.

We leave the architect's apartment and head to Mme Arlette's to present her with our findings. The guard lets us out with (somewhat forced) cheer.

FUCK WE COULD'VE USED THE LAB FOR THE GOAT

We take a circuitous route to Mme Arlette's, especially weaving through the docks to lose any obvious pursuers.

However, as we get to the Buried Bones station, there seems to be a problem: a crew of ten or so on the tracks, repairing them maybe?, and the train stopped behind them. Fabian notices: they aren't repairing the tracks at all, they're disassembling them! this is very strange since there aren't any new tracks around. He informs the rest of us of this.

He goes to confront them, Yala follows. She talks to the workers and politely asks wtf they're doing. One of the workers replies with a perfunctory "just doing my job, gotta do it".

Boss is back at the office. He names an address on the other side of the city. We find all this very suspicious. Artur, not as blinded by worker solidarity as Yala, realizes this is because the "worker" is bullshitting us.

Artur cuts in and asks after the exact purpose of this work. The worker gets increasingly sweaty, clearly trying desperately to deflect.

Yala lays out the options:
- you can put the tracks back, return to your employers unbruised, and explain that some scary adventurers showed up
- you get lightly scorched, return to your employers full of bruises, and explain that some scary adventurers showed up
surprisingly, given her +1 intimidation, this actually works.

We get to Mme Arlette's offices without further interruptions. They've gotten even more isolated and fortified.

She comes down to meet us, and Yala explains what we found. She dramatically reveals the key and extradimensional lab, to Mme Arlette's astonishment.

The documents make Mme Arlette very happy; however, they're not *immediately* useful. She was hoping for raw construction materials or security measures. Yala suggests the party could serve as transport.

At this point, someone comes in, shouting for Mme Arlette: one of her staff. There seems to be a mob gathering outside the auberge. They want food, she has to figure this out.

The party unloads the documents and Yala closes up the lab. Then, we go to look at the mob.

The auberge has some fortified observation positions on the roof. The mob consists mostly of hungry people, some infected. Some of them are armed, throwing things or shooting at the auberge. There is even a big fleshbeast with a cannon on its back that shot the walls, though it didn't penetrate. We also realize that the mob prevents us from leaving.

We decline to do anything for now, deciding to try waiting out the mob (for about half an hour). The situation does not improve. After some waffling, we approach Mme Arlette and offer our help, though we're expecting to get paid at some point (to be discussed later).

She accepts (grudingly, because we want at least a vague promise of payment first)

Yala fireballs a group of people on a nearby roof trying to throw ropes across. This kills some, sets some small fires on the roof, and induces one to shoot Yala.

Fabian gets put on door duty: there's a big fleshbeast with a battering ram there. He punches it nearly to death and drives it off.

Artur casts *revealing ligt* at the crowd.

The mob starts dispersing over the next hour.

We level up!

Two weeks pass. We do infection checks:

and prices double again.
