we have 50L of goat milk, each.

2 weeks downtime, cost of living is now 1.2 gp/wk
- disease rolls:
	- Yala succeeds -> stage down to 1
	- Haskell succeeds -> he's cured!
	- Artur succeeds -> stage down to 2
- Yala:
	- 1 wk earn income @lvl5, fail -> 1.4 gp
	- 1 wk earn income @lvl5, success -> 6.3 gp
- Haskell:
	- 2 wk earn income @lvl5, success -> 14 gp
- Artur:

shrooms: Fabian Morrow, fist monk with cleric archetype

cultist that got kicked outta cult for developing leprosy, came to pendleham seeking a cure and then got stuck under quarantine
kind of a buzzkill, scholarly, serves Velani (sp?): god of change, volcanoes. Fabian views this as a test, forced into a very different situation

we spend some time discussing Haskell's fantasies of revenge against the gang leader

Mme Arlette does have a job for us. she was actually wanting to meet us for a while, but it's hard to send messages around the city these days.

Getting there is safe, which is actually unusually lucky these days. The auberge is now looking rather less inviting, and more fortified: first-floor windows sealed, doors reinforced, workers digging a moat, etc.

People at the door still recognize us and let us through. Inside is a quasi-airlock setup; Mme Arlette invites us in and offers us tea, with the milk earned by our efforts.

She has a problem: she is trying to fortify the hotel, and needs us to find her materials and skilled workers for this. There is no strict deadline, but she can feel something brewing and wants to be ready.

Yala: any leads or places to start? A: not rly, doesn't even have a shopping list exactly. Does have one lead: there was supposed to be a semifamous architect guy, worked on many parts of the labs in Pendleham, other buildings. kind of a fortification guy. He kind of disappeared, nobody knows where he went, about a month ago. She gives us his address and notes that normally she'd just go there, but with the city as it is she doesn't really want to leave her house.

construction materials, fleshsmithed creatures, or magical stuff for big enchantments (gem powders, gems, etc)

she doesn't care where we get it, we can steal it, as long as we don't get caught or don't bring down heat on her head.

disassembling buildings: not really an option given the architecture technology, maybe fancier buildings would do.

plan: look for architect guy, if we find a pile of construction materials along the way we can toss them into the lab.

first step: go to architect guy's address, which is a little bit north of the alley of sight. we decide to take the metro, and run into someone on the way there:

guy rambling on the street, screaming at the world. pendleham will pay, this is karmic punishment for its sins, etc. we try and avoid him, but he spots us. He grabs for Haskell's arm.

Fabian steps in, and tries to engage the ranter by asking him to expand no his thesis. This works perfectly, to the dismay of the others. He blames the plague on the actions of the empire? and has a grievance of some kind against a recent political event, but it's unclear which one.

Artur spots that the ranter's eyes are red, he's definitely sick. Also, this is Zarel Kablinski, used to be a famous alchemist but fell from grace after several lab accidents. He was actually in several papers, there were repeat accidents, he blamed his competitors for sabotaging him, etc. He's hard to recognize since he used to dress well, but now his clothes are shabby, he's dirty, etc.

Zarel grabs at Fabian's hand and exhorts him: we have to cure the sickness, don't you see? Fabian agrees, but admits confusion about what exactly he's meant to do. Zarel doesn't accept this, and accuses us - we're all the same, nobody understands his genius, etc. He starts reaching into his robes.

Combat!

Round 1:
- He pulls out a flask, which he immediately drinks. His body ripples and explodes outwards into the form of a giant boar. He lets out a terrifying(?) squeal, which we all avoid (Haskell has to spend a hero point). He tries to bite Fabian, 35 crit for 26 p.
- Fabian uses flurry of blows, both attacks miss. He casts void warp, the boar crit suceeds.
- Artur casts evil eye, boar fails. cast slow, boar succeeds (slowed 1 for the round).
	- griffin: fly around
- Yala
	- RK, do linguistic effects still work? probably not, given his prior work
	- raise shield
	- protective wards
- Haskell: 3⋄ ring of the ram activation, boar succeeds: 9 b damage, pusyhed 5 ft.
Round 2:
- boar charge at haskell. squeal again: Yala fails, Haskell critfails. done because slowed.
	- Fabian notes the boar actually doesn't smell horrible
- Fabian uses Inner Upheaval for some empowered punches: 27 hit for  total, 18 miss. He strides away.
- Artur: 2⋄ cast revealing light, boar fails, is dazzled for 1 minute. 0⋄ cackle to sustain evil eye, extend duration of effects. move.
- Yala: sustain wards, run away, raise shield.
- Haskell: smack the boar, crit miss. run away into Yala's ward.

Round 3:
- boar: run after us. attack haskell, miss. It's still slowed.
- Fabian runs at the boar, tries more punching, misses. Enter tiger stance.
- Artur: 2⋄ cast befuddle, boar fails. 1⋄ sustain evil eye, griffin screech extend duration.
- Yala: 2⋄ fear the boar, it fails for frightened 2. sustian wards.
- Haskell's collar of the shifting spider belatedly triggers, injecting him with bestial mutagen. He starts clawing at the boar: 18 miss, 21 hit for 10 s + 1d6 persistent bleed

Round 4:
- Boar bites haskell, 27 hit {trigger gaping wound, doesn't do anything} for 16 p. bite again, hit for 16 p. bleed for 1.
- Fabian claws at the boar, misses four times.
- Artur descends to cantrips. electric arc, boar succeeds for 6. sustain again.
- Yala: needle darts for 7 p, sustain wards.
- Haskell: claw the boar for 14 s, raise shield, try a grab- success!

Round 5:
- boar attacks haskell, 25 hit for 16 p. again, miss. bleed for 3
- Fabian misses four times again
- Artur: TK projectile (slash), miss. sustian.
- Yala: needle darts miss, sustian wards.
- Haskell: attack boar, 33 crit for 20 s and 2×1d6 persistent bleed.

Round 6:
- boar attacks haskell, 27 hit for 20 p {shield block! -8 damage, shield is beaten up}. attacks again, 20 p -> down. bleeds for 2.
- Fabian attacks four times, for a hit (9 s) and a crit (6 s).
- Artur: apply life-boosting oil to haskell. cackle. reposition haskell.
- Yala: kick Haskell to start up the life-boosting oil. Fireball the boar, it succeeds and takes 9 damage.
- Haskell regains 3 HP and wakes. He stands, quick-alchs a lesser elixir of life, and quaffs it.

Round 7:
- boar runs at haskell, attacks him: 29 hit for 11 p. bleed for 12.
- Fabian: more punching, just one hit for 9 s. The boar is officially dead and explodes in a shower of gore, leaving behind Zarel's body (still dead).

we find two unID'd potions that look strikingly similar to the one he drank, and nothing else of note.
