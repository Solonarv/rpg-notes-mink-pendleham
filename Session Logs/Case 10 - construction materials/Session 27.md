Haskell identifies the potions: they turn you into a blood boar. roll a dc15 flat check to stay in control, else start killing whatever's closest.

we rest for half an hour: Haskell chugs potions, the rest of us regain focus points.

then we continue toward the missing architect's address.

this is not too far from the alley of sight, his building is easy to find: it's one of the tall not-quite-skyscrapers, very tall by pendleham standards, and his apartments are on one of the top floors. building isn't deserted, people come and go occasionally, and there are guards on the ground floor.

We head inside and explain our business to the receptionist: looking for this architect guy, we know he disappeared, but maybe if we find him our client can hire him, yeah?

guard explains he hasnt seen the architect much since the start of the sickness. he looks through the logs for us, finds that the architect left on that date (1 day after the gas incident in the walled city) and never returned.

guard is not willing to let us into the apartment, for fear of being fired etc. 

superiors' address: security firm in the city, they subcontract guards. Long Arm Enterprises. offices in a middle-class district, a bit further from the alley of sight, but not a *bad* area. we head there next.

the building is actually shaped like an arm (not actually particularly long, just scaled up). Artur notices that the building's skin (it has skin because it's an arm) is wrinkly, kind of sagging downward, and concludes that this building was grown and the builders ran out of resources to feed it, so it didn't get as long as was likely planned. The words "Long Arm Enterprises" are tattooed on the building above the door.

on the door is a sign: closed due to epidemic. please use emergency contact for emergencies (the emergency contact is not specified on the sign). peeking through windows, the interior seems empty.

we decide to try a little trespassing. Artur picks the lock on the front door (there appear to be no other doors). We're not sure if getting seen would be bad, with Artur and Yala coming to diametrically opposite conclusions regarding the neighborhood character, so she simply makes him invisible.

While picking the lock, Artur notices that it actually kinda sucks? it's more of a keep-out-your-little-brother lock. Thus, we're quickly inside.

We start poking around, looking primarily for:
- falsifiable authentication so the guard will let us in
- any links to the architect's disappearance?
- leads on construction materials?

second floor: conference/discussion space, desk with chairs around, kitchen in the corner

third floor: the files, more of an office space. pretty boring stuff, contracts with individual employees and properties. dates end about a week into the epidemic, presumably when the office closed. Also we find a book with emergency contacts: you just go to the managers' houses. Yala copies them.

We spend about two (2 (TWO)) hours here... or at least, we intend to. As we're wrapping up, someone comes knocking at the door, then enters on noticing the door isn't locked.

they look not too dissimilar from the guard we talked to earlier. quite tall, wearing a long trenchcoat of sorts. Yala takes refuge in audacity and simply explains the actual reason we broke in, and what we're looking for. This kinda works, with the addition of a 12gp bribe. We leave, and so do they.

We head to the closest manager's place, which is not very far away. It's somewhat similar to the house of the two doctors, two stories and clearly residential.

We go up to the front door and ring the bell (the dastardly GM's proposal to burn it down is delayed, "maybe later if she's mean to us"). Instead of the door opening, it's a second-floor window. A man looks out, with curling thingies in his hair, and asks who we are / what we want.

Yala says we're independent investigators looking into the disappearance of that architect guy. He doesn't want to let us into the house, since we might be infected, and so we end up talking up to the window.

She explains that we'd like to up to the apartment and look for clues, and the manager perks up: 

We return to the architect's tower, where Yala explains that we talked to (insert manager's name), where we learned he was working on the 

As he gets up to pull the lever and open the door for us, we can see that he's tall, and as his trenchcoat opens, we can see that he's got four arms and they're very long; the extra height comes from the extra ribcage to accommodate the extra arms.

Architect's apartment is the second-highest part of the building, with several doors that lead to it, but the guard has keys to them.

very clean and modern apartment, lots of wood, which has to be imported and thus is expensive. bit of dust from nobody cleaning for a while, but mostly a very nice multi-story apartment.

We look through the apartment for a good while. We find:
- architectural drawings, plans, diagrams
- two probably-trapped safes
- a secret room behind a bookcase
	- a smaller safe, also trapped
		- the magic here is: if you fuck up opening the lock, one mechanical and one hidden in the 'decorative' carvings, it'll blast some force somewhere (maybe throws something, maybe explode, something like that). It's not very strong.
		- Artur picks it without much difficulty
		- inside, we learn what the trap would do: there are several glass bottles on the inside of the door, containing a very familiar green gas. The trap magic would have broken the glass bottles
		- there are also some documents, partly in code, including some letters
			- even the non-coded letters are circumlocutory
			- seems like this architect was being recruited for something
			- on the day of the gas incident, there is a letter informing him that he has to leave now.
