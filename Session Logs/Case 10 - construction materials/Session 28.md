We attack the other two safes as well:
- first, we ponder how to mitigate the trap:
	- protective gear, antiplague on Artur (the lockpick)
	- somehow break the plague vials first, from a safe distance?
- Haskell inspects the safe to see if it could be attacked with acid
	- however, he finds it's actually made of very hard industrial metal, and merely plated with the prettier, weaker metal it appears to be made of.
		- we learn that mink rolled a safe-ing throw to see how good the safe is (it's very good)

Haskell doses Artur up with antiplague, and our witch gets to work with the rest of us at a (hopefully) safe distance.

The second safe is safely opened, it doesn't appear to be trapped at all and is full of just documents; mostly blueprints, contracts, customer information, supplier lists. Our guard starts to get worried that we're maybe ransacking the place a bit too much, but Yala successfully talks him down.

Artur unlocks the third safe as well. This one contains more personal documents, journals, letters: it seems the guy was corresponding (and presumably sleeping with) several women, and a small jewelry box. It shows some low-rank auras on Artur's detect magic, which is common enough for fancy jewelry. He goes to open it, and gets pricked by an entirely nonmagical needle. He fails the fort save, and his thumb starts turning green.

He elects not to do anything right now, and the effect starts to propagate. Upon examination, he guesses it's the same kind of effect as the plague, only more concentrated. Artur is now at stage 3.

He uses telekinetic hand to open the box this time. It contains jewelry - silver, gold, gems, etc. - but nothing of true interest.

Yala takes a crack at the coded documents from the secret-room safe, but it's not quick. An appeal to our job, alongside a generous 5gp bribe, convince the guard to leave us alone in the apartment while Yala spends hours deciphering the documents.

Artur takes advantage of the opportunity and copies the supplier lists.

Yala manages to crack the code:
- there is a part of the text encoded in a double-special way
- this is a diary of the last few months
- already gleaned that he knew something about this plague stuff
- actually, he was hired to design the lab of the clinic where we first saw the gas
	- detailed technical specifications
	- a secret/back entrance to the clinic that leads through the walled city and out, by a different path than the one we took
	- not much info about his employers (too paranoid to put into writing, even here)
- he was supposed to be picked up from this little pier on the river, if he needed extraction.
	- no mention of what is there, just this is where he was meant to go
- not many plans for where he'll go once outside the city, just mentions of some safe places.

Yala ponders informing the blockading forces about this guy. She doesn't know much about those forces, but she does know about a blue concordate office/embassy/??? whose staff hasn't been extracted yet. She prepares an information packet about the escaped architect, explaining that he had a hand in creating the plague, has most likely escaped Pendleham, and may be carrying plague.

We leave an anonymous note

She leaves a copy of this information packet with Artur, who doesn't accompany her, and goes to the Concordate office (actually the lab of a fleshsmith who's from there, where a bunch of Concordate expats tend to gather). Yala heard it's been fortified and is guarded, now.

She quickly finds that the doors are not so much locked as nonexistent. There is a second-story balcony with a rope ladder they drop down to let people in. A soldier on the balcony is smoking a cigarette, and warily observing the crowd.

Yala hails the soldier and at first vaguely mentions having important information. She then details a bit more:

She spins a tale of the architect possibly spreading the plague outside Pendleham, which terrifies the grunt into going inside and getting a sergeant.

She repeats this process, and the sergeant disappears inside for half an hour, then returns with a probably-officer wearing a very fancy hat, who demands the same explanation again.

She repeats it, though a bit less eloquently; it's still enough to convince them to lower a bucket for her documents.

We go back to the lair, and Yala looks over the list of suppliers, trying to prioritize. She concludes: Mme Arlette would also really appreciate the actual contracts, they would be a huge aid in negotiating and practically as good as bringing her the materials.

We ponder simply breaking/sneaking in. The building is pretty well-guarded, so it wouldn't be easy.

There are balconies, but they're locked, and may have other security measures.

Haskell spots Yala 50 gp for bribes (she'll return the extra later - no, he insists she can keep the change). Returning to the building, she spins some lies about needing to check the documents again, and crosses the guard's palm with ten shiny gold pieces, so he lets the party back in (and is very solicitous about it).

Seeing that the apartment is untouched, we get to work robbing it. We put all three safes' contents into the extradimensional lab.

Haskell takes Yala aside to ask just how poor she is (very), and gives her another 60 gp.
