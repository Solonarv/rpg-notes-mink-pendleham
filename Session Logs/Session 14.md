continuing combat from last time

- green cloak pokes head out. bombs central platform: Artur, Yala get pushed off, Haskell doesn't; Yala manages to grab the edge; Artur falls in the soup, but is unafffected. disappears into hatch again.
- Haskell does stuff
- Yala: sustain wards. try to climb up, critfail and fall in the soup; fort success, 6/2=3 poison, slowed 1. swim towards stairs.
- Bendren: traverse acid; reflex fail, 9 acid damage. leap onto center platform. lean down and lend a hand to artur for climbing back up.
- Artur: climb up w bendren's help. step. jump across to another walkway: a pipe explodes in his face, reflex save crit ok.

Round 3:
- green cloak: poke head out. bomb: Haskell fall, can't grab edge, into the soup, fort fail: 6 poison, slowed 1; Bendren reflex ok.
- Haskell: try to climb back up, fail. swim through poison x2.
- Yala: exit the soup by swim x2. { fail poison save, still slowed }
- Bendren: stand. stride. leap onto another walkway, right in front of green cloak's favorite hatch.
- Artur: seek { reaction: scholarly recollection }, find no traps. stride -> long jump, land on pump.

Round 4:
- green cloak: do nothing, it seems.
- Haskell: swim somewhere easier to climb x2. { save vs poison, fail: 5 poison, slowed 2.}
- Yala: stride and leap onto central platform. Yell at Bendren to block that vent. { slowed clears }
- Bendren: block off vent, craft 17 ok. Help Haskell up.
- Artur: inspect pump { reaction: scholarly recollection }, perception: pump was deliberately sabotaged in part, components all busted up, big steel thing jammed in the middle; no obvious way of fixing. again: the blood we've been swimming in belongs in the system! storage tanks below, blood overflowed, turning pump on would get rid of blood; some ideas on fixing it, seems doable. let griffin out.

Round 5:
- green cloak: poke out of another hatch, can now see: thin ledge, remainder of walkway. bomb artur: reflex fail, grab edge fail, into the soup: fort save crit ok.
- Haskell: climb up with bendren's help.
- Yala: move move move nearer the pump.
- Bendren: patch up the burst pipe next to him
- Artur: yell repair instructions at Yala. Swim away x3. { fort save vs soup, crit fail: 4 poison, slowed 2}

Round 6:
- green cloak: poke-bomb-hide at yala: reflex fails, reroll->succeed.
- Haskell: walk through acid, reflex critfail: 6\*2=12 damage.
- Yala: air-boosted jump to pump platform. repairing pump x2, success both times.
- Bendren: walk through some acid, reflex fail -> 17 acid. leap across a gap. try to fix pump, fail.
- Artur: swim onto the stairs. { fort save fail: 12 poison, paralyzed }

Round 7:
- green cloak: bomb Yala and Bendren, cant grab edge either. Yala gets poisoned again for 5 poison and slowed 1.
- Haskell: leap onto pump platform. help Bendren and Yala up.
- Yala: swim toward Haskell. climb up. 
- Bendren: climb up. try to fix pump, fail. again, crit success!
- Artur: still paralyzed. fort save ok, no longer paralyzed.

Round 8:
- green cloak: bomb the pump platform again; Yala and Haskell get knocked around, Yala grabs the edge, Haskell is in the soup: fort success
- Haskell: swim to central platform, 
- Yala: delay
- Bendren: draw pistol, ready to shoot the bomb.
- Yala: try to climb up, fail and fall in the soup; fort save ok. swim x2 toward stairs.
- Artur: crawl out of the soup.

Round 9:
- green cloak: nobody to usefully bomb, so Bendren shoots them instead { 18 miss } and gets a bomb to the face: 22 hit, reflex 22 fail get shoved into the wall: 5 bludg.
- Haskell: try to climb onto central platform, success. leap onto another platform. make and drink elixir of life.
- Bendren: sheathe pistol. fix the pump: it starts pumping. He asks "what the hell do you want!?"
- Yala: exit soup by staircase.
- Artur: do something wiht a crafting check?

Round 10:
- green cloak: observe and ponder. throw at Bendren, hit, reflex fail, smash into wall for 5 bludg.
- Haskell: duck under dripping acid, reflex crit ok. Try to plug acid, fail.
- Bendren: draw pistol, raise shield.
- Yala: fix some acid, reposition
- Artur: move

Round 11:
- green cloak: bomb Haskell, reflex save fail, no edge grab, into the soup! fort save ok. also bomb artur: reflex save succeed.
- Haskell: swim to central platform. climb up. leap to catwalk.
- Bendren: accidental shot @ green cloak. reload.
- Yala: pissed off. 3⋄ force barrage @ green cloak for 15 force.
- Artur: evil eye @ green cloak, will fails. command: approach, will fails.

Round 12:
- green cloak: crawls out and drops down, then yelps; fort save ok. swim around.
- Haskell: acid flask @ green cloak, 20 hit (base AC exactly 21) for 5 acid + 2 splash.
- Bendren: warning shot at the wall, say "approach the stairs, slowly, without ill intent". reload.
- Yala: reposition to get LoS on green cloak. Raise shield. "Look, we're really pissed off, but we don't *actually* have to kill you. Explain yourself." (diplomacy rolls a 2 lol).
- Artur: sustain evil eye. soothe @ self for 5 heal.

Round 13:
- green cloak: toss bomb between haskell and artur, artur succeeds reflex, haskell is in the soup but succeeds fort. swim toward exit, fail fort.
- Haskell: swim toward GC. grapple, succeeds. reposition to dunk, critfail: haskell gets dunked! { fort save vs poison: 31 ok }
- Bendren: move, through acid { reflex fail, take 20 acid }.
- Yala: drain bonded item for another 3⋄ force barrage, 12 damage. "You can speak up at any time, you know!"
- Artur: command Griffin { fly,  }. move. sustain evil eye, which lengthens debuff duration.

Round 14:
- green cloak: escape, 19 succeeds (barely). start fleeing.
- Haskell: make and drink bestial mutagen. run after GC. grapple again, 14 fails.
- Bendren: recovery check, success.
- Yala: reposition. cast needle darts @ GC, 22 hits for 13 p.
- Artur: { griffin flies to Yala }. Step. recast evil eye to fish for crit fail: it works! poison gets extended.

Combat is called: we manage to catch him. He raises his hands, begs for life. We pull down his cloak: it's Letek!
